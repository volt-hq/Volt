# @hansjm10/volt-agent-core

Stateful LLM orchestration, transactional message delivery, tool execution, session persistence, and a low-level agent loop. Built on `@hansjm10/volt-ai`.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @hansjm10/volt-agent-core@beta
```

## Quick start

`AgentHarness` is the public stateful orchestrator. Node applications also import `NodeExecutionEnv` from the package's `node` entry point.

```typescript
import {
  AgentHarness,
  InMemorySessionRepo,
} from "@hansjm10/volt-agent-core";
import { NodeExecutionEnv } from "@hansjm10/volt-agent-core/node";
import { getModel } from "@hansjm10/volt-ai";

const session = await new InMemorySessionRepo().create();
const harness = new AgentHarness({
  env: new NodeExecutionEnv({ cwd: process.cwd() }),
  session,
  model: getModel("anthropic", "claude-sonnet-4-5"),
  systemPrompt: "You are a helpful assistant.",
});

harness.subscribe((event) => {
  if (event.type === "message_update" && event.assistantMessageEvent.type === "text_delta") {
    process.stdout.write(event.assistantMessageEvent.delta);
  }
});

const response = await harness.prompt("Hello!");
console.log(response.stopReason);
```

`prompt()` is a convenience API that requires an assistant response. Use `run()` or `runPrompt()` when the caller needs the bounded `AgentRunResult`, including delivery outcomes.

## Ownership model

The package has two execution layers:

- `AgentHarness` is the reusable stateful orchestrator. It owns runtime configuration, queues, transactional delivery, persistence coordination, lifecycle state, hooks, and turn execution.
- `agent-loop.ts` is the stateless execution kernel. Use it only when the host needs to own all state, persistence, event settlement, and request policy itself.

The supplied `Session` is the persisted conversation authority. Store-issued projection cursors identify one branch revision, and guarded declarative batches are the only canonical mutation seam. Harness queues, operation leases, and overlays are runtime state; committed messages are written to the session.

## Messages and context

`AgentMessage` includes standard LLM messages (`user`, `assistant`, and `toolResult`) plus application messages added through declaration merging.

```typescript
declare module "@hansjm10/volt-agent-core" {
  interface CustomAgentMessages {
    notification: {
      role: "notification";
      text: string;
      timestamp: number;
    };
  }
}
```

Before each provider request, Harness applies context hooks and converts `AgentMessage[]` to provider-compatible `Message[]`. Supply `convertToLlm` when custom messages require application-specific filtering or conversion.

```typescript
const harness = new AgentHarness({
  env,
  session,
  model,
  convertToLlm: (messages) =>
    messages.flatMap((message) =>
      message.role === "user" || message.role === "assistant" || message.role === "toolResult"
        ? [message]
        : [],
    ),
});
```

A turn snapshot fixes the model, thinking level, active tools, resources, system prompt, stream options, and session context used by one provider request. Runtime setters affect future snapshots, not an in-flight request.

## Transactional delivery

Harness admits prompt, steering, and follow-up messages into one stable inbox. A host that owns canonical persistence installs an `AgentDeliveryOwner` before the delivery becomes visible:

```typescript
const deliveryOwner = {
  prepareLogical: ({ sourceMessages }) => ({
    outcome: "prepared",
    messages: sourceMessages,
  }),
  async commitAttempt({ deliveryId, epoch, attemptId, preparedMessages }) {
    const basis = await session.getBranchSnapshot();
    const result = await session.commitBatch({
      guard: { kind: "exact", cursor: basis.cursor },
      deliveryAttribution: { deliveryId, epoch, attemptId },
      mutations: preparedMessages.map((message) => ({
        kind: "append",
        entry: { type: "message", message },
      })),
    });
    if (result.outcome === "committed") {
      return { outcome: "committed", receipt: result.receipt };
    }
    if (result.outcome === "rolled_back") {
      const current = await session.getBranchSnapshot();
      const noEffect = await session.commitBatch({
        guard: { kind: "exact", cursor: current.cursor },
        deliveryAttribution: { deliveryId, epoch, attemptId },
        mutations: [],
      });
      if (noEffect.outcome === "committed") {
        return { outcome: "retained", error: result.error, noEffectReceipt: noEffect.receipt };
      }
      return { outcome: "terminally_failed", error: noEffect.error };
    }
    return { outcome: "terminally_failed", error: result.error, authority: "retired" };
  },
  finish: ({ outcome }) => updateHostProjection(outcome),
} satisfies AgentDeliveryOwner;

const harness = new AgentHarness({ env, session, model, deliveryOwner });
```

`prepareLogical()` is side-effect-free. One successful immutable preparation is cached for the logical delivery; a retained retry receives a fresh attempt ID without rerunning it. Preparation failure is retained only when the owner explicitly returns `retained`; thrown failures and unsafe effects are terminal.

`commitAttempt()` receives the frozen prepared messages and must return a store-verifiable committed or no-effect receipt bound to the delivery ID, inbox epoch, and attempt ID. Harness rejects forged, stale, cross-session, or same-delta receipts. An uncertain write retires the session authority and suppresses provider work. `finish()` is passive projection cleanup and cannot perform canonical writes.

Delivery outcomes are:

- `committed`: publish the delivery and permit provider work.
- `retained`: restore the same logical delivery and stable ID for explicit retry.
- `terminally_failed`: consume unsafe-to-replay work and stop the run.
- `revoked`: reported by Harness when explicit revocation wins before settlement begins.

A supplied owner owns canonical persistence for that delivery. Harness does not append the prepared delivery messages again. Without a custom owner, Harness uses its built-in owner and the supplied session's guarded batch API.

```typescript
const result = await harness.runPrompt("Apply the change");
if (result.status === "delivery_failed") {
  console.error(result.failure.phase, result.failure.error.message);
}
```

## Lifecycle and abort

`abort(source?)` records synchronous cancellation intent and returns an immutable `AgentAbortAcceptance`. The first accepted source is preserved. Abort does not implicitly clear queued work.

```typescript
const acceptance = harness.abort("remote_request");
if (acceptance.accepted) {
  await harness.waitForIdle();
}
```

Useful lifecycle projections include:

- `getPhase()`
- `signal`
- `activeRunSnapshot`
- `waitForIdle()`

Queue revocation is explicit:

```typescript
await harness.clearSteeringQueue();
await harness.clearFollowUpQueue();
await harness.clearAllQueues();
await harness.discardPendingPrompt();
```

`requestClose()` is the terminal synchronous fence. It rejects new admission and mutations, aborts an open operation, revokes work that has not crossed its commit boundary, and makes late callbacks inert. `dispose()` is its fence-only conventional alias and returns `void`; use `waitForClosed()` from external lifecycle code to join the active operation, delivery settlement, notifications, and persistence drain. Owner callbacks may request close but must not join closure from inside themselves.

## Prompting and queues

```typescript
await harness.prompt("Hello");
await harness.run({ role: "user", content: "Structured input", timestamp: Date.now() });

// During a run:
await harness.steer("Change direction");
await harness.followUp("Also summarize the result");
await harness.nextTurn("Include this with the next user-initiated turn");

// Admit already-structured queue messages synchronously:
const steerId = harness.queueSteer(userMessage);
const followUpId = harness.queueFollowUp(otherUserMessage);

// Resume retained work or a provider/tool continuation:
await harness.continue();
```

Harness owns deep snapshots of `run()`, `runPrompt()`, and `prompt()` messages, explicit context, images, and options before any asynchronous preflight. `continue()` similarly owns explicit context and dispatch options, and `promptFromTemplate()` owns its argument array before resolving runtime context. Later caller mutation cannot change admission, retries, or provider context.

`queueSteer()` and `queueFollowUp()` synchronously return after admission. Their async text counterparts, `steer()` and `followUp()`, wait for passive `queue_update` publication before resolving. Steering and follow-up modes are `"one-at-a-time"` or `"all"` and can be changed with their corresponding getters and setters.

## Tools

Tools implement `AgentTool`:

```typescript
import { Type } from "typebox";

const readFileTool = {
  name: "read_file",
  label: "Read file",
  description: "Read a UTF-8 file",
  parameters: Type.Object({ path: Type.String() }),
  executionMode: "sequential",
  async execute(toolCallId, params, signal, onUpdate) {
    onUpdate?.({ content: [{ type: "text", text: "Reading..." }], details: {} });
    const text = await fs.readFile(params.path, "utf8");
    return {
      content: [{ type: "text", text }],
      details: { path: params.path },
    };
  },
} satisfies AgentTool;
```

Configure all tools and the active subset separately:

```typescript
await harness.setTools([readFileTool], ["read_file"]);
await harness.setActiveTools(["read_file"]);
```

Thrown tool errors become failed tool results. Return `isError: true` to preserve structured failure details. A successful result may request `disposition: "stop"` or one bounded tool-free `disposition: "final_response"`.

## Hooks and events

Use `on()` for ordered mutation policy and `subscribe()` for finalized observation.

```typescript
const removeToolPolicy = harness.on("tool_call", (event) => {
  if (event.toolName === "bash") return { block: true, reason: "bash is disabled" };
});

const removeContextPolicy = harness.on("context", (event) => ({
  messages: pruneContext(event.messages),
}));

const unsubscribe = harness.subscribe(async (event) => {
  if (event.type === "agent_end") await flushUiProjection(event.messages);
});
```

Mutation hooks run in registration order before persistence or provider use, as appropriate for the event. Every `next_action` hook and scoped policy receives a fresh deep projection of messages, completed-turn results, and delivery payloads; tool arrays are copied while tool objects retain their callable identity. Only an explicitly returned action advances reducer state. Finalized subscribers receive cloned, passive projections. Subscriber mutation or failure cannot change committed delivery or terminal outcomes.

Important loop events include:

- `agent_start`, `agent_end`, and Harness `settled`
- `turn_start`, `turn_end`
- `delivery_start`
- `message_start`, `message_update`, `message_end`
- `tool_execution_start`, `tool_execution_update`, `tool_execution_end`
- `queue_update`

Provider hooks are `before_provider_request`, `before_provider_payload`, and `after_provider_response`. Request options include transport, retry limits, timeouts, WebSocket connect timeout, inference speed, thinking budgets, environment, headers, metadata, and cache retention.

Scoped next-action policy is available for bounded host policy such as subagent budgets:

```typescript
const unregister = harness.registerNextActionPolicy((context, _signal) => {
  return budgetExceeded(context) ? { type: "stop" } : undefined;
});
```

Return `undefined` to leave the suggested action unchanged. Returning `{ type: "stop" }` explicitly enforces a policy stop even when the suggestion was already `stop`; use `pause` for resumable interruptions such as compaction.

Harness emits `next_action_resolved` after all hooks and scoped policies, with the authority-normalized `action` and `requestAuthority`. Stop actions include `stopReason`: `completion`, `policy`, or `tool`. An awaited `on("next_action_resolved", ...)` handler can fence host-owned background continuations before the run settles, without changing the decision. Ordinary completion does not revoke independently authorized work. `subscribe()` receives the same finalized decision as a passive cloned projection.

## Session repositories

The package includes in-memory and JSONL repositories. Repositories create/open sessions; Harness receives one session instance.

```typescript
const repo = new InMemorySessionRepo();
const session = await repo.create({ id: "session-1" });
```

A custom `SessionStorage` must provide atomic branch snapshots and guarded declarative `commitBatch()` operations. Runtime storage exposes no imperative append or leaf setter; append, move, summary, and label effects all cross the guarded batch seam. The store issues opaque `ProjectionCursor` and `SessionMutationReceipt` capabilities, verifies receipt ownership, preserves parent/leaf ordering, and classifies every batch as `committed`, `rolled_back`, or `uncertain`. Exact guards are compare-and-swap; descendant guards may tail-append only while the cursor branch remains an ancestor. An uncertain authority must reject later canonical work until reopened or reconciled.

## Low-level loop

Use the low-level loop when the host intentionally owns orchestration:

```typescript
import { agentLoop } from "@hansjm10/volt-agent-core";

const context = {
  systemPrompt: "You are helpful.",
  messages: [],
  tools: [readFileTool],
};

const config = {
  model,
  convertToLlm,
  nextAction: async (context) => context.defaultAction,
};

for await (const event of agentLoop([userMessage], context, config)) {
  console.log(event.type);
}
```

`agentLoop()` and `agentLoopContinue()` preserve event order but do not provide Harness persistence, transactional inboxes, lifecycle snapshots, or hook settlement. Prefer `AgentHarness` unless the host needs to implement those responsibilities itself.
