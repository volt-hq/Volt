# Examples

Example code for volt-coding-agent SDK and extensions.

## Directories

### [sdk/](sdk/)
Programmatic usage via `createAgentSession()`. Shows how to customize models, prompts, tools, extensions, and session management.

### [extensions/](extensions/)
Example extensions demonstrating:
- Lifecycle event handlers (tool interception, safety gates, context modifications)
- Custom tools (todo lists, questions, subagents, output truncation)
- Commands and keyboard shortcuts
- Custom UI (footers, headers, editors, overlays)
- Git integration (checkpoints, auto-commit)
- System prompt modifications and custom compaction
- External integrations (SSH, file watchers, system theme sync)
- Custom providers (Anthropic with custom streaming, GitLab Duo)

## Not Included

The Iroh remote demo clients are available in Node.js package installs and source checkouts, but are not included in standalone Node SEA archives because they require the optional native `@number0/iroh` adapter.

The Doom overlay example is also repository-only and is excluded from
standalone archives because its prebuilt artifacts are outside the verified
standalone-release license inventory.
