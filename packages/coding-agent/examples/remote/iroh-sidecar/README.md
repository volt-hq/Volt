# Iroh remote demo clients

This example tunnels Volt RPC JSONL over an Iroh QUIC bidirectional stream.

The product host lives in Volt itself: `volt remote host` launches `packages/coding-agent/src/remote/iroh-host.mjs` from source checkouts, or the copied `dist/remote/iroh-host.mjs` from package installs. This directory keeps demo clients, fake-RPC fixtures, and compatibility wrappers for local remote-host testing.

## Install

From the repository root:

```bash
npm run iroh:poc:install
```

For direct demo-client commands from this directory after the repository root or containing package has already been installed:

```bash
npm install --ignore-scripts
```

`@number0/iroh` is now an optional dependency of `@earendil-works/volt-coding-agent`. Host commands use the product package install, so run root install before `volt remote host` or `npm run iroh:poc:host`. If `volt remote host` reports that the optional native adapter is unavailable, reinstall with optional dependencies enabled for the current platform. The example package can still install the dependency locally for direct client demos.

## Root scripts

From the repository root:

```bash
npm run iroh:poc:smoke                  # local fake-RPC smoke test
npm run iroh:poc:test                   # local fake-RPC scenario tests
npm run iroh:poc:host                   # product host with the fake-RPC child
npm run iroh:poc:host:volt              # integrated source Volt host for this checkout
npm run iroh:poc:client -- "<ticket>"    # one-shot client
npm run iroh:poc:client -- "<ticket>" --interactive  # persistent prompt loop
npm run iroh:poc:clients                # list paired clients
npm run iroh:poc:revoke -- <node-id>    # revoke a paired client
```

Pass extra host/client flags after `--`, for example:

```bash
npm run iroh:poc:host:volt -- --relay default --no-pairing
npm run iroh:poc:client -- "<ticket>" --message "List top-level files."
```

Use `npm run --silent ...` if you want stdout to contain only the ticket or client output.

## Local fake-RPC scenario tests

Run the automated local scenario suite when changing the remote host bridge:

```bash
npm run iroh:poc:test
```

The suite starts local host/client processes with isolated temporary state and covers fake-RPC prompt streaming, `get_state`, first-class `volt remote pair`, pairing persistence, `--no-pairing` rejection, revocation, expired tickets, and workspace preflight failures.

## Local fake-RPC smoke test

Terminal 1:

```bash
npm run iroh:poc:host -- --once
```

Copy the printed `volt+iroh://v1/...` ticket.

Terminal 2:

```bash
npm run iroh:poc:client -- "<ticket>" --message "hello from another device"
```

Or keep the connection open:

```bash
npm run iroh:poc:client -- "<ticket>" --interactive
```

Expected output for the one-shot command:

```text
fake RPC response over Iroh: hello from another device
```

The first successful connection persists the host key, client key, workspace, and paired client allowlist in state files:

```text
~/.volt/agent/remote/iroh-host.json
~/.volt/agent/remote/iroh-sidecar-client.json
```

Use `--state <path>` on host or client for isolated test state.

## Pairing and revocation

The host prints a pairing ticket by default. A client that connects with that ticket is added to the host allowlist for the selected workspace.

A running host also accepts local management requests from `volt remote pair`, which prints only the generated ticket on stdout:

```bash
volt remote host --workspace volt=/path/to/repo --no-pairing
volt remote pair --workspace volt
volt remote pair --workspace volt --allow-tools read,grep,find,ls,bash --yes
```

If no host is running for the selected `--state` file, or if the workspace is missing or ambiguous, `volt remote pair` fails with diagnostics on stderr and no ticket on stdout.

List paired clients:

```bash
npm run iroh:poc:clients
```

Revoke a client:

```bash
npm run iroh:poc:revoke -- <client-node-id>
```

After a client is paired, the host can run without accepting new clients:

```bash
npm run iroh:poc:host -- --no-pairing --once
```

In `--no-pairing` mode, the printed ticket contains no pairing secret. Only clients already stored in the host allowlist can connect.

## Test with real Volt RPC

Terminal 1, when testing this source checkout from the repository root:

```bash
npm run iroh:poc:host:volt -- --allow-tools read,grep,find,ls
```

The same integrated path is also available through the source CLI:

```bash
node scripts/run-coding-agent-source.mjs remote host --workspace volt=. --allow-tools read,grep,find,ls
```

Terminal 1, when testing another source checkout as a spawned RPC child from this directory:

```bash
npm run iroh:poc:host -- --source-volt /path/to/volt --workspace volt=/path/to/volt --allow-tools read,grep,find,ls
```

Terminal 1, when `volt` is globally installed on the host `PATH`:

```bash
npm run iroh:poc:host -- --use-volt --workspace volt=/path/to/repo --allow-tools read,grep,find,ls
```

Terminal 2, one-shot commands:

```bash
npm run iroh:poc:client -- "<ticket>" --get-state
npm run iroh:poc:client -- "<ticket>" --message "List the top-level files."
```

Terminal 2, persistent prompt loop:

```bash
npm run iroh:poc:client -- "<ticket>" --interactive
```

Interactive commands:

- `/state` prints current RPC session state.
- `/abort` sends an abort command.
- `/quit` or `/exit` exits the client.
- Ctrl+C aborts a running prompt; Ctrl+C while idle exits.

Add `--relay default` to the host command when testing across networks; the ticket carries the relay mode to the client. On Windows, a global install normally resolves through `volt.cmd` automatically when `--volt-bin` is omitted.

## Relay mode

The default is `--relay disabled`, which is best for same-machine or same-LAN testing. To exercise Iroh's relay/discovery path:

```bash
npm run iroh:poc:host -- --relay default --once
```

The ticket records the relay mode and the client uses the same preset.

## Security notes

Remote host support is experimental and should be treated as remote access to the host machine.

- Pairing tickets contain a one-time secret for adding a client to the allowlist.
- Paired clients are persisted until revoked.
- Any paired client can control the integrated runtime or spawned RPC child for its allowed workspace.
- Real Volt RPC can read files, edit files, and run tools allowed by `--allow-tools`.
- Keep the default read-only tool list while testing remotely.
- `--allow-tools` grants that include `bash`, `edit`, or `write` can modify host files or run shell commands; TTY host and pair commands ask for confirmation, and noninteractive commands must pass `--yes`.
- Do not expose sensitive workspaces or run with `bash,edit,write` unless the client is trusted.

See [the design document](../../../docs/iroh-remote-access-design.md) for the intended product security model.
