# Background daemon (voltd)

`voltd` is a persistent background daemon that owns Volt's remote-access
plane: the stable Iroh endpoint identity, phone pairing and revocation,
workspace registration, push notification dispatch, headless conversation
runtimes, and the conversation lease broker that lets a phone and a desktop
TUI share one live conversation.

It replaces the old foreground `volt remote host` process. Remote access no
longer requires a dedicated terminal: the daemon keeps running when every TUI
is closed, and paired phones stay paired across restarts because the Iroh
secret key lives in the daemon's state file.

## Quick start

```bash
volt daemon start          # start the daemon (no-op if already running)
volt remote pair           # pair a phone (QR / ticket)
volt daemon status         # inspect workspaces, clients, leases
```

Every supported interactive Volt process connects to a running daemon,
registers its working directory as a workspace, and acquires a conversation
lease for the open session so a paired phone can co-attach to it live. Set
`remote.background: true` to additionally start the daemon on demand. A TUI
that was already open while the daemon was stopped reconnects automatically
when another process starts it.

## CLI

```
volt daemon start                 Start the background daemon.
volt daemon stop                  Graceful shutdown (state flushed, phones notified).
volt daemon status [--json]       Status; exit 0 only when phone transport is ready.
volt daemon restart               Stop then start; persistent state survives.
volt daemon logs [-f] [-n N]      Tail the daemon log.
volt daemon install-service       Register a login service (launchd/systemd).
volt daemon uninstall-service     Remove the login service.
volt daemon run --foreground      Run in this process (internal; used by start).

volt remote pair [--workspace <name>]   Create a pairing ticket, wait for the phone.
volt remote status [--json]             Same status view as volt daemon status.
volt remote clients                     List paired clients.
volt remote credential revoke           Reset this daemon's managed relay credentials.
volt remote revoke <node-id>            Revoke a client and close its connections.
volt remote approve-repair <node-id>    Allow a revoked node ID to re-pair.
volt remote workspace add [path] [--name <name>]
volt remote workspace remove <name>
volt remote workspace list
volt remote worktree add [--workspace <name>] [--name <id>] [--branch <ref>] [--base <ref>]
volt remote worktree list [--workspace <name>] [--json]
volt remote worktree remove <id> [--workspace <name>] [--force]
volt remote worktree prune [--workspace <name>]
volt remote worktree diff <id> [--workspace <name>]
```

`volt remote host` is gone; running it prints a pointer to `volt daemon
start`. The daemon requires a Node.js npm install or source checkout with the
exact required `@hansjm10/volt-iroh` wrapper and its optional selected native
binding. Installs made with `--omit=optional` cannot provide phone transport,
and Darwin x64 has no binding. Standalone Node SEA builds do not bundle Iroh and
cannot host the daemon.

`volt daemon install-service` writes a launchd LaunchAgent (macOS) or a
systemd user unit (Linux) that starts the daemon at login. The service does
not auto-restart after a graceful `volt daemon stop`; on Linux, run
`loginctl enable-linger` if the daemon should also run without an active
login session.

## Manage remote access from the TUI

Open `/remote` to inspect connections, pair a phone, and revoke device access.
For managed relays, **Relay access** reports enrollment, token expiry, inactive
Volt Pro subscriptions, and pending credential resets separately from the
local daemon endpoint. An endpoint marked ready does not mean relay access is
active.

Use **Pair a phone** for another phone using the same active subscription. If
Volt Pro is inactive, renew the existing subscription; the daemon retries
credential refresh automatically. **Refresh status** reloads the display, not
the subscription itself.

To enroll using a different subscribed phone, choose **Reset credentials and
pair again…**. Review the confirmation (Cancel is selected by default). Reset
revokes the computer's entire managed relay grant, including its phones' relay
credentials, and cancels outstanding pairing codes. It preserves the computer
identity, workspaces, worktrees, conversations, and existing device permissions.
**It does not revoke direct device access**; revoke old phones separately under
**Paired devices**.

After reset, choose the new phone's access level and workspace, then scan the
fresh pairing QR and verify its details. No daemon restart is needed. If the
broker is unavailable, the reset remains pending: retry it when online before
pairing. On the CLI, the equivalent is `volt remote credential revoke`, followed
by `volt remote pair` after revocation succeeds; the CLI revoke command runs
without an interactive confirmation.

## File layout

Everything lives under `~/.volt/agent/daemon/` (mode `0700`):

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `voltd.sock` | Control socket (JSONL protocol; mode `0600`) |
| `voltd.pid` | Advisory pidfile; liveness truth is always a socket probe |
| `voltd.log` | Daemon log (`volt daemon logs`) |
| `state.json` | Iroh secret key, paired clients, workspaces, settings (`0600`) |
| `work-state.json` | Private, bounded session-to-change and pull-request associations (`0600`) |
| `audit.jsonl` | Append-only audit log (pairing, leases, relays, lifecycle) |

On first start the daemon migrates the legacy `remote/iroh-host.json` state
file automatically and renames it to `.migrated`. A pre-grant file keeps the
Iroh secret key (so the saved host identity does not rotate) plus validated
workspace/worktree metadata, but intentionally drops active clients, revoked
clients, and pending pairing tickets. The daemon logs and audits this expected
migration as `legacy_remote_access_dropped`; it is not corruption. Every old
client must pair again to receive an explicit current grant.

## Session storage

Conversation history uses the same authoritative SQLite storage as local Volt.
Each registered workspace's session directory, or an explicitly configured
session directory, contains `sessions.sqlite`; session lists and resumes use its
indexes. The daemon addresses conversations by stable workspace/session IDs and
never sends the database path, session directory, or host-side
`SessionReference` over the remote wire.

Daemon handoffs reopen stable session identities from SQLite; they do not
transfer or reopen JSONL snapshot files.

## Configured remote agents

Hosts advertising `agent_options.v1` expose a read-only workspace-discovery
stream with purpose `agent_options`. `get_agent_options` requires
`model.select.v1`, is bound to the stream-authorized workspace, and returns the
current authenticated model catalog plus a complete default model, thinking,
Fast, and Build/Plan configuration. Discovery creates no session or runtime,
changes no selection, provisions no worktree, and does not mutate host
defaults.

Clients own configured-agent setup. They keep one caller-generated session ID
for the retry intent, optionally provision a deterministic worktree through
`create_worktree`, then open a normal conversation with `target:"new"`, that
session ID, and the chosen placement. The first attach creates the exact
session identity; identical retries resume it, including after daemon restart,
and concurrent attempts wait for the same runtime publication. Reusing the ID
with a different workspace, worktree, or working directory fails closed.

After attach, clients apply model, thinking level, Fast mode, and Build/Plan
mode as session-only commands, in that order, before sending the initial prompt.
A configuration failure leaves one empty resumable session and sends no prompt.
A successfully provisioned worktree is intentionally retained if a later step
fails; the client offers retry or explicit removal instead of expecting the
daemon to roll unrelated resources back. Prompt retries use the normal stable
command-ID receipt path, so neither configured attach nor prompt delivery needs
a launch receipt or transaction store.

## Conversation leases

Exactly one process owns the live runtime for each `(workspace, session)`
conversation at a time:

- **daemon-active / daemon-detached** — the daemon runs a headless runtime for
  phones. When the last phone disconnects, the runtime is retained for
  `remote.detachedRuntimeTtlMs` (default 30 minutes) so a reattach is warm.
- **tui-owned** — a desktop TUI owns the runtime. The daemon still terminates
  the phone's Iroh connection, then relays the raw stream bytes to the TUI,
  which serves it from its in-process session. Prompts from either side appear
  on both; the TUI footer shows `📱 n` while phones are attached.
- **daemon-draining** — a TUI asked to take over while a remote turn is
  streaming. The TUI shows a read-only "Attaching — finishing remote turn…"
  viewer, phones get transient `lease_draining` errors on new prompts, and
  ownership transfers at the turn boundary.

Handoffs are invisible on the phone: when a TUI takes over or quits, the
daemon closes phone streams with reason `lease_transferred` and the app
reconnects immediately to the new owner. Abort is non-destructive everywhere:
stopping a turn never closes streams or disposes runtimes.

When the TUI owns the lease, phone prompts run with the TUI session's full
local tool set. `remote.allowTools` applies only to daemon-owned headless
runtimes — see [Security](security.md).

## Work and pull-request association

The daemon observes fresh path-free Git branch state from whichever process
owns a conversation lease. Daemon runtimes publish directly; a TUI may publish
only over the exact local control connection holding that `(workspace,
session)` lease. Phone input and `list_sessions` requests cannot choose an
association or start provider discovery.

For trusted workspaces, the daemon uses configured Git remotes plus the local
authenticated `gh` CLI to match the exact head repository, branch, and object
ID. Provider failure remains distinct from “no pull request,” ambiguous matches
are not guessed, and configured/default base branches such as `main` are not
grouped across sessions. A positive PR match is sticky: later checkouts,
refresh failures, branch reuse, or a newer PR do not silently move the session
to another change. Set `remote.pullRequestDiscovery: false` to disable provider
calls.

Associations are stored separately in private `work-state.json`. The file uses
opaque local IDs and a salted hash of the common Git directory; checkout paths,
credentials, raw provider output, and provider diagnostics are not projected to
phones. `list_sessions.workContext` contains only the opaque change ID,
repository display name, effective branch, resolution state, and bounded PR
summary described in [Iroh Remote Protocol](iroh-remote-protocol.md#remote-rpc-command-allowlist).

## Git worktrees

Concurrent sessions in one workspace share one checkout by default — two
agents will step on each other's files and branches. The daemon can instead
run a session inside a **daemon-managed git worktree**: an isolated checkout
on its own branch under `~/.volt/agent/worktrees/` (0700). Create worktrees
with `volt remote worktree add`, from the TUI's `/worktree` command, or from a
paired phone (`manage_worktrees` stream, gated on the `worktrees.v1` feature);
then open a conversation with `target:"new"`, a caller-generated `sessionId`,
and a `worktreeId`.

Key behaviors:

- **Sessions stay with the parent workspace.** Worktree sessions use the
  parent workspace's SQLite store and remain listed there; leases, push
  notifications, and `list_sessions` are unchanged. The daemon persists a
  session→worktree binding so resumes (phone reattach, daemon restart, TUI
  takeover) land back in the worktree checkout.
- **Policy inheritance.** A worktree runtime uses exactly the parent
  workspace's trust decision and tool allowlist — never wider. Trust is never
  prompted for or persisted on worktree paths.
- **Branch layout.** Each worktree gets its own branch (default
  `volt/<id>`) off the recorded base ref (default: the checkout's current
  branch). `volt remote worktree list` shows dirtiness and ahead/behind counts
  against the base; `volt remote worktree diff <id>` shows the branch diff.
  Merging back is always a user action — the daemon never mutates the main
  checkout.
- **Removal safety.** `worktree remove` refuses dirty or in-use worktrees
  without `--force`; force stops bound runtimes first. `worktree prune`
  reconciles records against the filesystem and quarantines unrecognized
  directories by renaming (never deleting) them.
- **Fresh checkouts are fresh.** Worktrees share git objects but not
  untracked files: `node_modules`, virtualenvs, and build caches must be
  reinstalled per worktree.

Cleanup policies live in `state.json` under `settings.worktreeCleanup`:

```json
{ "worktreeCleanup": { "retention": { "enabled": true, "ttlMs": 3600000 }, "pruneOnStart": true } }
```

- `retention` (off by default): after a worktree-bound runtime is disposed,
  remove the worktree once the TTL expires — but only when it is clean and its
  branch is fully merged into the base ref. Skips are recorded in the audit
  log as `worktree_retention_skipped_dirty`; uncommitted work is never
  deleted.
- `pruneOnStart` (default `true`): reconcile worktree records and checkouts
  during daemon startup.

Downgrade caveat: older daemons drop the `worktrees` state collection on
their next write. Checkouts survive on disk as orphans; re-upgrading and
running `volt remote worktree prune` quarantines them.

## Optional: theme token push (experimental)

With `VOLT_HOST_THEME_TOKENS=1` in the daemon's environment (or
`settings.themeTokenPush` in `state.json`), the daemon pushes its resolved
theme colors to phones that advertise the `host_theme_tokens.v1` capability as
`host_theme_tokens` frames (hex color values only — nothing path-like ever
crosses the wire). Off by default; clients that ignore the frame are fully
supported.

## Troubleshooting

- `volt daemon status --json` reports `remoteTransport.state` as `starting`,
  `ready`, `degraded`, or `unavailable`, plus a safe reason code/message and the
  wrapper version when discoverable. Both daemon and remote status exit nonzero
  unless phone transport is `ready`; local daemon workspace/client maintenance
  remains available while it is not ready.
- `native_binding_missing` → reinstall without `--omit=optional` on a supported
  platform. Darwin x64 is intentionally local CLI/TUI only.
- `endpoint_start_failed` → inspect `volt daemon logs`, fix the reported host
  issue, then restart the daemon.
- `host_storage_full` → free computer disk/quota capacity, then retry. Rejected
  handshakes do not create an in-memory authorization, and the phone keeps its
  saved pairing, selected agent, and transcript.
- `volt daemon status` reports that the daemon is not running → run `volt daemon
  start` and check `volt daemon logs`.
- Stale socket after a crash: `volt daemon start` probes the socket, unlinks
  it when dead, and rebinds.
- A second daemon on the same agent dir exits immediately (single-instance is
  guaranteed by the socket bind).
- Phone shows an "in use" error: the existing daemon-owned runtime permits tools outside this phone's persisted grant, so it cannot safely co-attach. Re-pair with a compatible grant or close the broader runtime. A `duplicate_conversation_connection` error instead means the same phone raced two connections and retries on its own.
- Full audit trail: `~/.volt/agent/daemon/audit.jsonl` records pairing,
  revocation, lease transitions, and daemon lifecycle for post-hoc review.
