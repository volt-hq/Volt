# LSP Diagnostics & Navigation

Volt can run language servers and feed diagnostics back to the model after every `edit` and `write`. When enabled, the tool result includes a `Diagnostics:` block with errors reported by the matching language server, so the model sees type and compile errors immediately instead of discovering them at build time.

When LSP is enabled, the model also gets an `lsp` tool for code navigation and refactoring: go-to-definition, find-references, hover, file symbol outlines, on-demand diagnostics, project-wide rename, and quick fixes (e.g. auto-import).

## Default and Disabling

Diagnostics are on by default. To disable them, set `lsp.enabled` to `false` in `~/.volt/agent/settings.json` (or per project in `.volt/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "lsp": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

Use `volt --lsp` to force-enable LSP for a run when settings disable it.

## How It Works

- Servers are spawned lazily: the first `edit`/`write` to a file with a matching extension starts the server for that file's server root.
- LSP can access files outside the current workspace, just like Volt's file tools. Absolute paths, relative paths such as `../shared/src/index.ts`, and symlink aliases work for diagnostics, navigation, refactoring, and server-initiated edits. Existing paths (or the nearest existing ancestor for new files) are canonicalized so aliases share document and server state; dangling symlinks still fail resolution. Normal tool grants and Plan mode's read-only action restrictions still apply.
- The session's canonical project workspace remains the base for configured commands and traces. It is normally the startup directory; remote and managed-worktree runtimes may retain the registered workspace or checkout while tools run from a nested directory. Accessing another repository does not load that repository's Volt settings, extensions, or other project resources: external servers use the current session's LSP configuration.
- For files inside the project workspace, server-root discovery searches upward only to that workspace and falls back to it. Markers are priority-ordered entry names: for TypeScript, a `tsconfig.json` inside the workspace wins over a closer `package.json`. For external files, the search stops at the nearest `.git` entry (including worktree `.git` files), or before climbing into the home directory or filesystem root. Without a matching marker, it uses that repository root or, for loose files, the file's directory. External projects get separate lazily started clients rather than broadening the current server to index their common parent.
- After each successful `edit`/`write`, volt syncs the new file content to the server and collects diagnostics, using pull diagnostics (`textDocument/diagnostic`) when the server supports them, otherwise waiting up to `settleMs` for the server to publish. The first collection on a freshly started server waits up to `firstSettleMs` instead, because some servers publish nothing until the project has loaded.
- Before every diagnostics collection or navigation query, volt re-syncs any previously opened file whose on-disk content changed outside the `edit`/`write` tools (e.g. via `bash`: `git checkout`, codegen). Deleted files are closed on the server, and servers are notified via `workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles`.
- Diagnostics at or above the configured `severity` are appended to the tool result and shown in the TUI. Other open files that go from clean to failing as a result of the change are reported in a `Newly failing in other open files` section (capped at 5 files; best-effort, depends on the server republishing within the settle window).
- One client runs per canonical `(server, server root)` pair. A failure in one nested root does not disable that server in another root. Servers shut down when the session ends or reloads, and after `idleShutdownMs` without use (they respawn lazily on the next operation).
- `/lsp` shows the project workspace, server root, resolved executable (or unresolved command), launch source, start attempts, open documents, idle time, and retained startup error. `/lsp restart` stops all owned processes and clears failed-start breakers so servers resolve and spawn fresh on next use.
- `/lsp trace [path]` enables protocol tracing at runtime (`/lsp trace off` disables): JSON-RPC traffic in both directions, server stderr, workspace/server roots, resolved launch context, attempts, and lifecycle events are appended with timestamps. Relative runtime paths and persistent `lsp.traceFile` paths resolve from the canonical project workspace, not the process invocation directory or nested runtime cwd.
- Only a genuinely missing bare command from an unchanged built-in server definition can trigger a trusted automatic install prompt. Install prompts and concurrent attempts coalesce by reviewed recipe; cancelling one caller stops only its wait, while the shared install continues without affecting that root's startup breaker. After success Volt searches PATH again before retrying. Explicit paths, custom commands, manual-install-only servers, and present-but-broken executables are never auto-installed. Their retained status includes the resolved command, bounded startup stderr, and manual repair guidance. After three failed starts only that `(server, root)` record is disabled until `/lsp restart` or `/reload`.

Diagnostics are best-effort: server failures or timeouts never fail the edit itself.

## The lsp Tool

When LSP is enabled, the `lsp` tool is active by default (it still respects `--tools` and `--exclude-tools`). Actions:

| Action | Parameters | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| `definition` | `path`, `symbol`, `line?` | Where a symbol is defined, with a source snippet |
| `references` | `path`, `symbol`, `line?` | All usages of a symbol across the project (capped at 50) |
| `implementations` | `path`, `symbol`, `line?` | Implementations of an interface or abstract symbol |
| `type-definition` | `path`, `symbol`, `line?` | Where a symbol's type is defined |
| `callers` | `path`, `symbol`, `line?` | Functions that call the symbol (call hierarchy, one level) |
| `callees` | `path`, `symbol`, `line?` | Functions the symbol calls (call hierarchy, one level) |
| `hover` | `path`, `symbol`, `line?` | Type signature and documentation for a symbol |
| `symbols` | `path`, `symbol?` | Hierarchical symbol outline of a file; with `symbol`, a project-wide symbol search (the `path` routes the query to the right server) |
| `diagnostics` | `path` | Current diagnostics for a file, on demand |
| `rename` | `path`, `symbol`, `newName`, `line?` | Rename a symbol across the project (applies the server's WorkspaceEdit to disk) |
| `fix` | `path`, `symbol?` or `line?`, `title?`, `kind?` | Apply a quick fix (e.g. add a missing import). A single available action applies automatically; multiple actions are listed and chosen via `title`. `kind` filters by code-action kind, e.g. `source.organizeImports` or `source.fixAll` over the whole file |

The symbol is located by name: volt finds its position in the file (preferring a word-boundary match on the hinted `line`) and issues the positional LSP request. Errors such as a missing server or symbol are returned as text so the model can react.

`rename` and `fix` write the server's `WorkspaceEdit` to disk (including create/rename/delete file operations), re-sync changed open documents, and report a per-file summary. Edits may span projects: filesystem handles expand to cover the explicit edit targets without changing language-server roots. Every operation is preflighted before mutation, retaining document-version, stale-content, and rooted file-operation checks. Non-file URIs and filesystem roots are not valid mutation targets; resource renames between different filesystem volumes are unsupported. Command-based code actions use `workspace/executeCommand`, and server-initiated `workspace/applyEdit` requests use the same edit handling.

## Built-in Servers

The matching server must be installed on the exact inherited `PATH`. Volt does not implicitly execute `node_modules/.bin`. Bare commands are searched in PATH order; relative PATH entries are based at the canonical project workspace. On Windows, commands with an explicit filename extension are probed as named before any `PATHEXT`-derived fallback, while extensionless commands use `PATHEXT` order for PATH, project-relative, and absolute launch forms. Commands containing `/` or `\\` resolve from the project workspace. All remaining command entries are passed as literal argv through Volt's cross-platform spawn wrapper, without shell joining.

When a trusted built-in bare command is missing, interactive and capable RPC hosts can ask to install it automatically, then search PATH again and retry the LSP operation. Non-interactive hosts, clients that do not advertise host action support, overridden command argv, custom commands, explicit paths, and manual-install-only servers fall back to repair context or an install hint. Built-in defaults:

The TypeScript default uses TypeScript 7's native language server, so it does not require the `typescript-language-server` bridge.

| Name | Command | Extensions | Root markers | Install |
|------|---------|------------|--------------|---------|
| `typescript` | `tsc --lsp --stdio` | `.ts` `.tsx` `.mts` `.cts` `.js` `.jsx` `.mjs` `.cjs` | `tsconfig.json`, `jsconfig.json`, `package.json` | `npm install -g typescript@7.0.2` |
| `python` | `pyright-langserver --stdio` | `.py` `.pyi` | `pyrightconfig.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `requirements.txt` | `npm install -g pyright` |
| `go` | `gopls` | `.go` | `go.mod`, `go.work` | `go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest` |
| `rust` | `rust-analyzer` | `.rs` | `Cargo.toml` | `rustup component add rust-analyzer` |
| `cpp` | `clangd` | `.c` `.h` `.cpp` `.cc` `.cxx` `.hpp` `.hh` | `compile_commands.json`, `compile_flags.txt`, `.clangd` | [clangd.llvm.org/installation](https://clangd.llvm.org/installation) |
| `zig` | `zls` | `.zig` | `build.zig` | [github.com/zigtools/zls](https://github.com/zigtools/zls) |
| `lua` | `lua-language-server` | `.lua` | `.luarc.json`, `.luarc.jsonc` | [luals.github.io/#install](https://luals.github.io/#install) |
| `bash` | `bash-language-server start` | `.sh` `.bash` | (project workspace fallback) | `npm install -g bash-language-server` |

## Configuration

All settings live under `lsp` in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "lsp": {
    "settleMs": 1500,
    "maxDiagnostics": 20,
    "severity": "error",
    "servers": {
      "typescript": {
        "command": ["tsc", "--lsp", "--stdio"]
      },
      "rust": {
        "enabled": false
      },
      "zig": {
        "command": ["zls"],
        "fileExtensions": [".zig"],
        "rootMarkers": ["build.zig"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Master switch; set `false` to disable (`--lsp` force-enables per run) |
| `settleMs` | number | `1500` | How long to wait for published diagnostics after a change (servers without pull diagnostics) |
| `firstSettleMs` | number | `10000` | Wait window for the first diagnostics from a freshly started server (project load time) |
| `idleShutdownMs` | number | `600000` | Shut down servers idle for this long (10 minutes); `0` disables idle shutdown |
| `traceFile` | string | | Append protocol traffic, server stderr, resolved launch context, and lifecycle events to this file; relative paths resolve from the canonical project workspace (also `/lsp trace` at runtime) |
| `maxDiagnostics` | number | `20` | Maximum diagnostics per tool call; the rest are summarized as `... and N more` |
| `severity` | string | `"error"` | Minimum severity to report: `error`, `warning`, `information`, or `hint` |
| `servers.<name>` | object | | Server definition, merged over the built-in default with the same name |

Per-server fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `command` | string[] | Launch argv. Absolute executables are preserved, explicit relative executables resolve from the project workspace, and bare names use only inherited PATH/PATHEXT; no shell or implicit `node_modules/.bin` lookup |
| `fileExtensions` | string[] | File extensions routed to this server |
| `rootMarkers` | string[] | Priority-ordered file/directory entry names marking a server root; searched within the current workspace or the external project discovery range described above |
| `initializationOptions` | any | Passed to the server in the `initialize` request |
| `settings` | object | Server configuration: sent via `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` after startup and used to answer `workspace/configuration` section requests (dot-separated section paths look up into this object) |
| `enabled` | boolean | Set `false` to disable a built-in server |

Example: tuning pyright through `settings`:

```json
{
  "lsp": {
    "servers": {
      "python": {
        "settings": {
          "python": { "analysis": { "typeCheckingMode": "strict" } }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

User entries merge field-wise over built-in defaults: overriding only `command` for `typescript` keeps the default extensions and root markers.

## Limitations

- Disk changes are only detected for files the server has already seen (opened by an earlier edit, write, or `lsp` query). Files created or changed via `bash` that were never touched by a tool are unknown to the server until first opened.
- Diagnostics are collected only for the edited file, not for other files the change may affect.
- On very large projects the first collection can still miss diagnostics if project loading exceeds `firstSettleMs`; raise it in settings if needed.
