# LSP Diagnostics

Volt can run language servers and feed diagnostics back to the model after every `edit` and `write`. When enabled, the tool result includes a `Diagnostics:` block with errors reported by the matching language server, so the model sees type and compile errors immediately instead of discovering them at build time.

## Enabling

Diagnostics are off by default. Enable them per run:

```bash
volt --lsp
```

Or persistently in `~/.volt/agent/settings.json` (or per project in `.volt/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "lsp": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

## How It Works

- Servers are spawned lazily: the first `edit`/`write` to a file with a matching extension starts the server for that file's project root.
- The project root is found by walking up from the edited file looking for the server's `rootMarkers` (falling back to the working directory).
- After each successful `edit`/`write`, volt syncs the new file content to the server and collects diagnostics, using pull diagnostics (`textDocument/diagnostic`) when the server supports them, otherwise waiting up to `settleMs` for the server to publish.
- Diagnostics at or above the configured `severity` are appended to the tool result and shown in the TUI.
- One client runs per (server, project root) pair. Servers shut down when the session ends or reloads.
- A server that fails to start (for example, not installed) is reported once in the tool result and then silenced; after three failed starts it is disabled for the session.

Diagnostics are best-effort: server failures or timeouts never fail the edit itself.

## Built-in Servers

The matching server must be installed and on your `PATH`. Built-in defaults:

| Name | Command | Extensions | Root markers |
|------|---------|------------|--------------|
| `typescript` | `typescript-language-server --stdio` | `.ts` `.tsx` `.mts` `.cts` `.js` `.jsx` `.mjs` `.cjs` | `tsconfig.json`, `jsconfig.json`, `package.json` |
| `python` | `pyright-langserver --stdio` | `.py` `.pyi` | `pyrightconfig.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `requirements.txt` |
| `go` | `gopls` | `.go` | `go.mod`, `go.work` |
| `rust` | `rust-analyzer` | `.rs` | `Cargo.toml` |

## Configuration

All settings live under `lsp` in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "lsp": {
    "enabled": true,
    "settleMs": 1500,
    "maxDiagnostics": 20,
    "severity": "error",
    "servers": {
      "typescript": {
        "command": ["bunx", "typescript-language-server", "--stdio"]
      },
      "rust": {
        "enabled": false
      },
      "zig": {
        "command": ["zls"],
        "fileExtensions": [".zig"],
        "rootMarkers": ["build.zig"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `false` | Master switch (also `--lsp` per run) |
| `settleMs` | number | `1500` | How long to wait for published diagnostics after a change (servers without pull diagnostics) |
| `maxDiagnostics` | number | `20` | Maximum diagnostics per tool call; the rest are summarized as `... and N more` |
| `severity` | string | `"error"` | Minimum severity to report: `error`, `warning`, `information`, or `hint` |
| `servers.<name>` | object | | Server definition, merged over the built-in default with the same name |

Per-server fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `command` | string[] | Launch command, argv-style |
| `fileExtensions` | string[] | File extensions routed to this server |
| `rootMarkers` | string[] | Files/directories marking the project root, searched upward from the edited file |
| `initializationOptions` | any | Passed to the server in the `initialize` request |
| `enabled` | boolean | Set `false` to disable a built-in server |

User entries merge field-wise over built-in defaults: overriding only `command` for `typescript` keeps the default extensions and root markers.

## Limitations

- Only files changed through the `edit` and `write` tools are synced to servers. Changes made via `bash` (e.g. `git checkout`) are not pushed, so cross-file diagnostics can be stale until the affected files are edited again.
- Some servers index the project after startup; diagnostics for the first edit may be incomplete if the server has not finished loading. Servers that support pull diagnostics (e.g. typescript-language-server 4+) are more reliable here.
- Diagnostics are collected only for the edited file, not for other files the change may affect.
