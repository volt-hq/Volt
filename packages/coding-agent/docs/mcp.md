# Native MCP support

Status: native gateway MVP implemented; this document also captures the intended feature-complete direction for remaining UI, auth, and management work.

Implemented today:

- config loading from `~/.config/mcp/mcp.json`, `~/.volt/agent/mcp.json`, trusted project `.mcp.json`, and trusted project `.volt/mcp.json`
- one model-visible `mcp` gateway tool for status, server listing, cached search/describe, tool calls, resources, prompts (when enabled), and large-output cache reads
- stdio, Streamable HTTP, and legacy SSE transports through the official TypeScript MCP SDK
- project trust gating, restricted stdio env inheritance, include/exclude tool filters, output truncation/cache, metadata cache with stale refresh on detail/call paths, recent calls, audit logs, and local/RPC server status management
- `volt mcp` CLI inspection/management commands and lightweight `/mcp` interactive status/actions
- browser OAuth authorization-code + PKCE and OAuth device-code auth for HTTP/SSE MCP servers, with host-side token storage
- persisted enable/disable overlays in Volt-owned MCP config files
- optional direct tool promotion from fresh cached metadata via `directTools`
- optional per-server `trustedReads` declarations for operation-authorized reads in restricted session profiles
- MCP lifecycle event streaming (`mcp_events.v1`): the manager emits `mcp_servers_changed`, `mcp_server_status_changed`, `mcp_auth_request`, `mcp_auth_update`, and `mcp_call_start`/`mcp_call_update`/`mcp_call_end` through the AgentSession event stream, so TUI, RPC, daemon, and mobile clients observe MCP state without polling; the iOS app routes these into live server/auth/call state
- iOS MCP surfaces: a host-approval card for pushed auth requests (mirroring LSP install approvals), live active-call display in the MCP servers view, and chat transcript tool cards that render gateway and direct-tool calls as `mcp <server>.<tool>` with risk, truncation, and cache-id visibility

Not yet implemented from the roadmap sections below: full-screen `/mcp` TUI manager and direct-tool metadata demotion UI.

## Summary

Volt should ship MCP as a core capability, not as a third-party extension. The default model is a token-efficient gateway: Volt exposes one native `mcp` tool to the model, manages configured MCP servers itself, and lets the model search, inspect, and call MCP tools through that gateway. Volt should not register every upstream MCP tool directly by default.

This gives Volt MCP support that works across all tool-capable providers. It avoids provider-specific lazy-tool features such as Claude Code Tool Search, while preserving the same core benefit: upstream tool definitions are loaded only when needed.

Prior art:

- Pi `pi-mcp-adapter` uses one proxy tool with search, describe, call, lazy server startup, cached metadata, and optional direct tools: <https://pi.dev/packages/pi-mcp-adapter>
- `@spences10/pi-mcp` emphasizes project trust, restricted child environments, large-output handling, status UI, and server management: <https://pi.dev/packages/%40spences10/pi-mcp>
- Claude Code Tool Search defers MCP tools and loads only needed definitions, but relies on provider/model support for `tool_reference`: <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp>
- Goose Code Mode uses a small set of meta-tools for on-demand discovery and programmatic execution: <https://goose-docs.ai/docs/guides/managing-tools/code-mode/>
- MCPProxy's retrieve/call routing modes validate the proxy pattern for large tool sets: <https://docs.mcpproxy.app/features/routing-modes/>
- Official TypeScript SDK v1 provides `Client`, `StdioClientTransport`, `StreamableHTTPClientTransport`, and legacy `SSEClientTransport`: <https://ts.sdk.modelcontextprotocol.io/client>

## Goals

- Add native MCP server support to Volt.
- Make the default integration token-efficient by exposing one `mcp` gateway tool, not all MCP tools.
- Support local stdio MCP servers and remote Streamable HTTP MCP servers.
- Support legacy SSE only as a compatibility path.
- Let TUI, print/json, RPC, daemon, and mobile clients understand MCP state.
- Let mobile clients see and manage MCP servers connected to the selected agent/session.
- Respect Volt project trust before loading project-local executable MCP configuration.
- Treat MCP tool metadata, results, resources, and prompts as untrusted content.
- Provide first-class auth, tool filtering, audit, output truncation, and large-output retrieval.

## Non-goals

- Do not require users to install a separate MCP extension.
- Do not register every upstream MCP tool directly by default.
- Do not make provider-specific tool search a requirement.
- Do not let mobile clients add arbitrary local stdio commands.
- Do not treat MCP resources or prompts as trusted instructions.
- Do not silently inherit ambient host secrets into MCP stdio processes.

## Product UX

### TUI

Add a native `/mcp` command that opens a server manager.

The server manager shows:

- configured server id and display name
- config source: user shared, user Volt, project shared, project Volt
- enabled or disabled
- transport: stdio, Streamable HTTP, or SSE
- lifecycle: lazy, eager, or keep-alive
- status: untrusted, cold, connecting, connected, ready, needs auth, error, disconnected
- cached and live tool counts
- resource and prompt counts
- last error
- last connected time
- recent calls
- available actions

Actions:

- enable or disable server
- connect or disconnect
- refresh metadata
- start auth
- inspect tools/resources/prompts
- view recent calls
- open config file
- promote selected tools to direct native tools only after an explicit token-budget warning

Startup/header behavior:

- Show that MCP is enabled when configured.
- Show ignored project-local MCP config when project trust is not granted.
- Show auth/error counts compactly.

Footer/status behavior:

```text
MCP 4 configured / 1 connected / 1 auth
```

Tool rendering:

- `mcp` calls render as `mcp <server>.<tool>` when the action is a tool call.
- Search and describe calls render as compact discovery events.
- Results default to a small summary with expandable details.
- Truncation and sidecar/cache ids are visible.

### Print, JSON, and RPC modes

- Load global MCP config and trusted project MCP config only.
- Do not prompt for project trust in non-interactive modes; follow existing `defaultProjectTrust`, `--approve`, and `--no-approve` behavior.
- Do not apply nested MCP tool approval prompts. In unrestricted Build sessions, an available top-level `mcp` tool executes calls that pass server/tool filters. Restricted profiles additionally require host-owned operation authorization as described under `trustedReads`.
- JSON/RPC event streams include MCP status, auth, and call lifecycle events.

### Daemon and mobile

The mobile app should be able to inspect and manage MCP for a selected workspace/session through RPC/daemon APIs.

Mobile views:

- MCP server list for the selected agent/session
- server details with sanitized command/URL display
- enabled/disabled state
- connection/auth/error state
- tool/resource/prompt counts
- recent calls and audit summaries
- connect/disconnect/refresh/auth actions where allowed

Mobile must not store MCP credentials. OAuth tokens, bearer tokens, and env secrets stay on the host. Mobile can participate in auth flows by displaying a URL/device code and sending completion/cancel events back to the host.

Mobile must not add or edit arbitrary stdio commands by default. It can enable, disable, connect, disconnect, refresh, and authenticate servers already present in trusted host config, subject to the remote-safe command allowlist.

## Config model

### File locations

Support shared ecosystem config plus Volt-owned config. Load in this precedence order, lowest to highest:

1. `~/.config/mcp/mcp.json` — shared user MCP config.
2. `~/.volt/agent/mcp.json` — Volt user MCP config.
3. `.mcp.json` — shared project MCP config.
4. `.volt/mcp.json` — Volt project MCP config.

Volt should write only Volt-owned files by default:

- user writes go to `~/.volt/agent/mcp.json`
- project writes go to `.volt/mcp.json`

Editing shared files requires an explicit command or UI choice.

### Example

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "settings": {
    "enabled": true,
    "mode": "proxy",
    "idleTimeoutMs": 600000,
    "connectTimeoutMs": 15000,
    "callTimeoutMs": 600000,
    "maxOutputBytes": 51200,
    "maxOutputLines": 2000,
    "directTools": false,
    "resources": "explicit",
    "prompts": "user-preview"
  },
  "servers": {
    "github": {
      "enabled": true,
      "transport": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "cwd": ".",
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "${env:GITHUB_TOKEN}"
      },
      "lifecycle": "lazy",
      "includeTools": [],
      "excludeTools": [],
      "trustedReads": {
        "resources": false,
        "tools": ["search_issues", "get_file_contents"]
      }
    },
    "linear": {
      "enabled": true,
      "transport": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://mcp.linear.app/mcp",
      "auth": { "type": "oauth" },
      "lifecycle": "lazy"
    }
  }
}
```

### Server fields

Common fields:

- `enabled?: boolean`
- `transport?: "stdio" | "streamable-http" | "sse"`
- `lifecycle?: "lazy" | "eager" | "keep-alive"`
- `includeTools?: string[]`
- `excludeTools?: string[]`
- `directTools?: boolean | string[]`
- `trustedReads?: { resources?: boolean; tools?: string[] }`
- `connectTimeoutMs?: number`
- `callTimeoutMs?: number`
- `idleTimeoutMs?: number`
- `metadataRefreshMs?: number`

Stdio fields:

- `command: string`
- `args?: string[]`
- `cwd?: string`
- `env?: Record<string, string>`
- `envAllowlist?: string[]`

HTTP/SSE fields:

- `url: string`
- `headers?: Record<string, string>`
- `auth?: { type: "none" | "bearer" | "oauth" | "env"; ... }`
- OAuth auth also supports `flow?: "browser" | "device" | "auto"`, `scope?: string`, `clientId?: string`, `clientSecret?: string`, `clientMetadataUrl?: string`, `resourceMetadataUrl?: string`, and `tokenEndpointAuthMethod?: "client_secret_basic" | "client_secret_post" | "none"`.

### Merge rules

- `settings` merge like Volt settings: nested objects merge, arrays replace.
- `servers` merge by server id within the same trust scope (user-to-user, project-to-project).
- A project server definition with the same id as a user server replaces the user-scope definition instead of inheriting auth, headers, or env.
- A higher-precedence `enabled: false` disables an inherited server.
- `null` removes an inherited field.
- Arrays replace rather than append.
- Server ids are normalized to a safe stable id and collisions are diagnostics.

### Trust rules

Project MCP files are executable configuration because stdio servers can spawn local commands. Loading `.mcp.json` or `.volt/mcp.json` requires project trust.

Without project trust:

- ignore project MCP config
- emit diagnostics/status saying project MCP config was ignored
- continue to load user MCP config

Non-interactive modes follow existing Volt project trust behavior:

- `defaultProjectTrust: "ask"` behaves like not trusted
- `defaultProjectTrust: "never"` ignores project MCP
- `defaultProjectTrust: "always"` trusts project MCP
- `--approve` trusts for this run
- `--no-approve` ignores project MCP

### Trusted reads in restricted profiles

`trustedReads` is mode-neutral user trust evidence for restrictive read profiles; it is not a claim made by the MCP server and does not make returned content trusted instructions.

- `resources: true` authorizes that server's resource list/read operations as integration reads.
- `tools` is an exact-name allowlist. Each listed tool must also pass the server's normal `includeTools`/`excludeTools` filters, have fresh metadata with `readOnlyHint: true`, and have no write or destructive conflict after camelCase, PascalCase, and separator-aware risk tokenization. Missing, stale, filtered, ambiguous, annotation-only, or conflicting metadata fails closed.
- Status, server listing, and metadata search are discovery operations. Connecting to a server requires at least one configured trusted-read category; describing/listing tools requires configured trusted tools, while listing/reading resources requires `resources: true`. Cached result reads are discovery operations too: replaying stored output needs no per-server trust and does not count as fresh research evidence.
- Restricted metadata refreshes issue only the protocol operations authorized for that server: tool metadata for configured trusted tools and resource metadata only with `resources: true`. Plan never requests prompt metadata, including during eager startup, connect, list, describe, or pre-call revalidation.
- Tool prompts, authentication, enable/disable, disconnect/logout, and other lifecycle/configuration actions are not reads. A restricted research profile does not grant them.
- `includeTools`/`excludeTools` still apply. `trustedReads` can only narrow authority; it does not bypass normal filtering, project trust, authentication, or transport controls.
- Immediately before a restricted tool invocation, Volt refreshes metadata and revalidates the exact configured tool name, effective filters, `readOnlyHint`, and risk. A metadata change between authorization and execution therefore fails closed.
- MCP protocol results with `isError: true` or `status: "failed"` remain structured for rendering and audit but propagate as failed top-level agent tool results.

Plan uses Volt's reusable research capability profile, which grants integration discovery/read but not integration prompt/write. Other future restricted modes can reuse the same profile or a capability subset without adding mode-specific fields to MCP config. Before Plan returns to Build, Volt awaits unrestricted eager/keep-alive startup, rebuilds direct tools from fresh metadata, and reapplies the session's allow/exclude policy; servers skipped during restricted startup are therefore available before Build is exposed.

## Runtime architecture

Add a new core package area:

```text
packages/coding-agent/src/core/mcp/
  audit.ts
  auth.ts
  client-factory.ts
  config-loader.ts
  config.ts
  gateway-tool.ts
  manager.ts
  metadata-cache.ts

  safety.ts
  search.ts
  server-supervisor.ts
  types.ts
```

### Responsibilities

`config.ts`

- TypeScript config types.
- Validation helpers.
- Normalization of server ids and paths.

`config-loader.ts`

- Load all config files.
- Apply trust filtering.
- Merge sources.
- Produce diagnostics with source metadata.

`manager.ts`

`client-factory.ts`

- Creates SDK `Client` and transports.
- Uses `StdioClientTransport` for local commands.
- Uses `StreamableHTTPClientTransport` for remote HTTP.
- Uses `SSEClientTransport` only as fallback/compatibility.

`metadata-cache.ts`

- Caches tools/resources/prompts per server.
- Stores metadata hash, server version, last seen time, and schema snippets.
- Supports search without connecting at startup.

`search.ts`

- Local lexical/BM25-style search over cached metadata.
- Must be deterministic, fast, and dependency-light unless a stronger search dependency is justified.

`gateway-tool.ts`

- Provides the native `mcp` `ToolDefinition`.
- Handles action validation, result shaping, rendering, and truncation notices.

`safety.ts`

- Classifies tools as read/write/destructive/unknown for display, search, recent calls, and audit metadata.
- Redacts secret-looking arguments and text before audit/log presentation.

`auth.ts`

- Handles OAuth/bearer/env-missing auth flows.
- Emits first-class auth events for TUI/RPC/mobile.
- Stores host-side tokens securely where Volt auth storage supports it.

`output-store.ts`

- Stores large MCP outputs in a local sidecar.
- Returns opaque ids, never host-local paths to mobile.

`audit.ts`

- Writes MCP audit events.
- Redacts secrets and full outputs.

`rpc.ts`

- Projects manager state into RPC-safe DTOs.
- Sanitizes command, env, URL, headers, and auth data.

### Lifecycle

Startup:

1. Load trusted MCP config.
2. Load metadata cache.
3. Construct MCP manager.
4. Register only the native `mcp` tool when MCP is enabled.
5. Start eager/keep-alive servers from trusted config. Restricted startup starts only servers with trusted resources or configured, normally filtered trusted tools, and refreshes only those authorized metadata categories without listing prompts.
6. Lazy servers remain cold. A later transition to Build awaits unrestricted eager/keep-alive startup and rebuilds direct tools from fresh metadata before exposing Build.

Search/describe:

1. Use cached metadata first.
2. If metadata is missing or stale, return a clear result with suggested `connect`/`refresh` action.
3. Do not start arbitrary stdio processes merely because the model searched, unless config permits background discovery.

Call:

1. Resolve exact server and tool.
2. Ensure server is connected.
3. Refresh metadata if needed; restricted trusted reads always refresh immediately before invocation.
4. In a restricted context, revalidate configured exact-name trust, normal filters, `readOnlyHint`, and risk against the refreshed tool.
5. Call the tool with timeout and cancellation.
6. Truncate/cache output and propagate protocol-level failed results as top-level tool failures.
7. Emit events and audit.
8. Reset the idle timer.

Shutdown:

- Close clients.
- Stop stdio processes gracefully.
- Emit final status.

## Native `mcp` tool contract

### Tool name

```text
mcp
```

### Actions

```text
status
list_servers
search
describe
call
connect
disconnect
list_resources
read_resource
list_prompts
get_prompt
read_cache
```

### Input shape

```ts
interface McpGatewayInput {
  action:
    | "status"
    | "list_servers"
    | "search"
    | "describe"
    | "call"
    | "connect"
    | "disconnect"
    | "list_resources"
    | "read_resource"
    | "list_prompts"
    | "get_prompt"
    | "read_cache";
  server?: string;
  query?: string;
  tool?: string;
  arguments?: Record<string, unknown>;
  argumentsJson?: string;
  resourceUri?: string;
  prompt?: string;
  cacheId?: string;
  limit?: number;
  cursor?: string;
}
```

`arguments` is preferred. `argumentsJson` exists for provider compatibility if a model struggles with nested arbitrary JSON.

### Search result

Search returns compact routing information, not full schemas.

```json
{
  "action": "search",
  "query": "search github issues",
  "matches": [
    {
      "server": "github",
      "tool": "search_issues",
      "title": "Search issues",
      "summary": "Search GitHub issues and pull requests.",
      "risk": "read",
      "call": "mcp({\"action\":\"call\",\"server\":\"github\",\"tool\":\"search_issues\",\"arguments\":{...}})",
      "describe": "mcp({\"action\":\"describe\",\"server\":\"github\",\"tool\":\"search_issues\"})"
    }
  ]
}
```

Defaults:

- return 8 matches
- cap at 20 matches
- each match summary is bounded
- include risk and exact call target

### Describe result

`list_tools` returns tool names, descriptions of up to 180 characters, risk, and trusted-read status. Server identity, metadata hash, and stale state appear once for the list. Use `search` to narrow discovery and `describe` to retrieve a selected tool's schemas. CLI and RPC management inspection retain the full tool metadata.

`describe` returns the input schema and optional output schema for the selected tool only:

```json
{
  "server": "github",
  "tool": "search_issues",
  "description": "Search GitHub issues and pull requests.",
  "risk": "read",
  "inputSchema": { "type": "object", "properties": { "query": { "type": "string" } } },
  "annotations": { "readOnlyHint": true },
  "metadataHash": "sha256:..."
}
```

Large descriptions and schemas produce a bounded preview with a cache reference. Retrieve the complete result with `read_cache`; schema constraints are not simplified or discarded.

### Call result

```json
{
  "action": "call",
  "server": "github",
  "tool": "search_issues",
  "status": "completed",
  "risk": "read",
  "content": "Found 12 issues...",
  "truncation": {
    "truncated": true,
    "returnedBytes": 51200,
    "totalBytes": 482991
  },
  "cache": {
    "id": "mcpout_01HX...",
    "read": "mcp({\"action\":\"read_cache\",\"cacheId\":\"mcpout_01HX...\"})"
  }
}
```

Errors from MCP tool execution retain their structured failed call result for rendering and audit and are also marked as top-level agent tool failures when the protocol reports `isError: true` or `status: "failed"`. Transport/protocol/permission failures are reported as gateway errors.

## Token budget strategy

- One native tool is always visible.
- MCP tool schemas are absent from the base system prompt by default.
- Search results are compact and limited.
- Describe returns one tool schema at a time.
- All model-facing gateway and direct-tool results, including failures and cache pages, are serialized as compact JSON within `maxOutputBytes` (50 KiB by default). The final bound includes JSON escaping and truncation/cache metadata. Compact JSON is one physical line; raw call/resource/prompt previews also use `maxOutputLines` (2000 by default).
- Full results go to a sidecar and are retrieved by `read_cache`.
- Direct tools are off by default.

Optional direct tools:

```json
{
  "settings": { "directTools": false },
  "servers": {
    "github": {
      "directTools": ["search_issues", "get_file_contents"]
    }
  }
}
```

Direct tools must:

- be sourced from cached metadata
- include a token estimate before enabling in TUI/mobile
- be pinned to a metadata hash
- be demoted when metadata changes
- use names like `mcp__github__search_issues`

## RPC, daemon, and mobile API

### RPC commands

Add typed RPC commands:

```text
get_mcp_capabilities
list_mcp_servers
get_mcp_server
set_mcp_server_enabled
connect_mcp_server
disconnect_mcp_server
refresh_mcp_server
list_mcp_tools
get_mcp_tool
list_mcp_resources
read_mcp_resource
list_mcp_prompts
get_mcp_prompt
list_mcp_recent_calls
start_mcp_server_auth
poll_mcp_server_auth
cancel_mcp_server_auth
complete_mcp_server_auth
logout_mcp_server
```

### Events

```text
mcp_servers_changed
mcp_server_status_changed
mcp_auth_request
mcp_auth_update
mcp_call_start
mcp_call_update
mcp_call_end
```

### DTOs

```ts
interface McpServerSummary {
  id: string;
  displayName: string;
  sourceScope: "user" | "project" | "temporary";
  sourceLabel: string;
  enabled: boolean;
  activeInSession: boolean;
  transport: "stdio" | "streamable_http" | "sse";
  lifecycle: "lazy" | "eager" | "keep_alive";
  status:
    | "disabled"
    | "untrusted"
    | "cold"
    | "connecting"
    | "connected"
    | "ready"
    | "needs_auth"
    | "error"
    | "disconnected";
  authState: "none" | "required" | "pending" | "authenticated" | "failed";
  toolCounts: { cached: number; live?: number; enabled?: number };
  resourceCount?: number;
  promptCount?: number;
  recentCalls: McpRecentCallSummary[];
  lastError?: string;
  lastConnectedAt?: string;
  capabilities: {
    canEnable: boolean;
    canConnect: boolean;
    canDisconnect: boolean;
    canRefresh: boolean;
    canAuthenticate: boolean;
    canPersistChanges: boolean;
  };
}
```

```ts
interface McpRecentCallSummary {
  id: string;
  timestamp: string;
  server: string;
  tool: string;
  risk: "read" | "write" | "destructive" | "unknown";
  status: "started" | "completed" | "failed" | "cancelled";
  durationMs?: number;
  outputBytes?: number;
  truncated?: boolean;
}
```

### Mobile app integration points

Likely app-side files to add or change:

- `volt-app/Packages/VoltClient/Sources/VoltRPC/` for MCP RPC commands and DTOs.
- `volt-app/Packages/VoltClient/Sources/VoltCore/VoltSession+MCP.swift` for session state/actions.
- `volt-app/Packages/VoltClient/Sources/VoltCore/VoltSession+EventRouting.swift` for MCP event handling.
- `volt-app/Volt/Settings/MCPServersView.swift` for server management UI.
- `volt-app/Volt/HostAction/` or a new MCP auth sheet for auth prompts.
- `volt-app/Volt/Chat/ToolEvents/` for MCP call card presentation.
- `volt-app/Packages/VoltClient/Tests/VoltCoreTests/` for command/event routing tests.

### Daemon and remote access

Add an Iroh/daemon feature flag:

```text
mcp_management.v1
```

Remote-safe MCP commands should be allowlisted deliberately. Management commands that do not add or edit arbitrary stdio commands are remote-safe when the server already exists in trusted config.

Remote-safe by default:

- list servers
- get server
- connect existing configured servers
- refresh metadata for existing configured servers
- enable/disable existing configured servers through persisted Volt-owned overlays
- list recent calls
- list/get tools
- list/read resources
- list/get prompts
- disconnect
- start device-code auth
- poll/cancel auth
- logout

Conditionally remote-safe:

- browser redirect auth completion, only for local/same-device RPC flows with explicit redirect handling

Not remote-safe by default:

- adding arbitrary stdio server commands
- editing command/args/env
- changing env allowlists

## Security

### Threat model

MCP introduces these risks:

- stdio config can execute arbitrary local commands
- project config can be malicious
- server metadata can contain prompt injection
- tool outputs/resources/prompts can contain prompt injection
- remote MCP servers can exfiltrate data or ask for broad OAuth scopes
- mobile/daemon control can start host-local processes if not constrained

### Child process safety

For stdio servers:

- spawn argv directly, no shell
- resolve command and cwd safely
- do not pass full ambient environment by default
- pass baseline environment only:
  - `PATH`, `HOME`, `TMPDIR`, platform essentials
  - explicit `env` entries
  - explicit allowlisted ambient env vars
- redact env values in UI/RPC/mobile
- show command preview before first start when interactive

### Risk classification

Classify each MCP tool for display, search ranking context, recent calls, and audit metadata:

1. MCP annotations, such as `readOnlyHint` and `destructiveHint`
2. name/description heuristics
3. `unknown` fallback

Risk classes:

- `read`
- `write`
- `destructive`
- `unknown`

Risk remains informational in unrestricted Build sessions, where Volt does not add nested MCP approval prompts. In a restricted profile, however, host-owned operation authorization may use risk only as corroborating evidence: an exact, normally filtered `trustedReads.tools` entry and `readOnlyHint: true` are both required, while write/destructive/unknown conflicts fail closed. Name and description checks tokenize camelCase, PascalCase, acronym, and separator boundaries before matching mutation verbs. Server annotations alone never grant authority, and restricted calls refresh and revalidate immediately before invocation. Normal `includeTools`/`excludeTools`, project trust, auth, and transport/remote-safety rules continue to apply in every mode.

### Audit

Write JSONL audit entries under the Volt agent dir.

Fields:

- timestamp
- workspace/session id
- caller surface
- server id
- tool/resource/prompt id
- risk class
- status
- duration
- result size
- result hash
- truncation/cache id
- sanitized argument summary

Do not log secrets or full outputs by default.

## Resources and prompts

### Resources

Support resources in the product, but expose them explicitly.

Gateway actions:

- `list_resources`
- `read_resource`

Rules:

- never auto-inject resource contents
- return bounded content
- cache large resources
- treat contents as untrusted
- mobile/TUI can preview resources

### Prompts

Support prompt listing and preview, but do not auto-register MCP prompts as Volt slash commands by default.

Gateway actions:

- `list_prompts`
- `get_prompt`

Rules:

- prompt content is untrusted data
- user confirmation required before inserting or sending a prompt from UI
- model can call `get_prompt` only if config allows prompt exposure
- no prompt content gets system-prompt priority

Recommended default:

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "resources": "explicit",
    "prompts": "user-preview"
  }
}
```

## Error handling, timeouts, and cancellation

### Status values

Use a stable status vocabulary:

```text
disabled
untrusted
cold
discovering
connecting
connected
ready
needs_auth
authenticating
error
disconnecting
disconnected
```

### Timeouts

Default timeouts:

- connect: 15 seconds
- metadata discovery: 10 seconds
- tool call: 10 minutes
- auth prompt: 5 minutes
- idle disconnect: 10 minutes

Each server can override within safe bounds.

### Cancellation

- Agent abort signal cancels active gateway operations.
- RPC abort cancels active MCP management operations.
- On stdio shutdown:
  1. close stdin
  2. send SIGTERM
  3. send SIGKILL after grace period
- On session shutdown, disconnect session-owned MCP clients.
- On daemon/TUI handoff, reconnect as needed and emit status changes.

## Output truncation and sidecar

Inline output cap:

- 50KB
- 2000 lines

When output exceeds limits:

- return a compact summary
- store full output in local sidecar
- return opaque `cacheId`
- allow retrieval with `mcp({ "action": "read_cache", "cacheId": "..." })`

The `content` of a truncated discovery result is a preview of serialized JSON, not a complete JSON document. `read_cache` returns chunks of the cached text; concatenate their `content` fields in order to reconstruct it. Use the returned `nextCursor` unchanged for the next request. It advances by the original UTF-8 bytes actually returned, so JSON escaping can reduce a page's content size. `limit` is a positive integer byte ceiling; an invalid cursor or a limit too small for the next complete Unicode character returns an error.

Existing call/resource/prompt cache references are reused when the final JSON envelope needs a smaller preview. Cache reads do not create more cache entries. If output cannot be retained, the model-facing result reports `cacheUnavailable: true` instead of a retrieval reference. Narrow discovery with `search` and `describe`; for calls, request less output from the upstream tool.

Sidecar rules:

- local file permissions 0600 where applicable
- retention/TTL setting
- mobile sees opaque ids only, not host paths
- cache ids scoped to workspace/session ownership
- binary/image outputs require explicit product handling before model exposure

## Implementation plan

### 1. Dependency and config foundation

- Add pinned `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` dependency.
- Add MCP config types and loader.
- Add file discovery for global/shared and project-local MCP config.

### 6. Auth

Implemented:

- OAuth/bearer/env-missing auth states.
- Host-side OAuth token/client/discovery storage in `~/.volt/agent/mcp-auth.json` with owner-only file permissions.
- Browser authorization-code + PKCE auth via `volt mcp auth <server>` and local RPC `start_mcp_server_auth` / `complete_mcp_server_auth`.
- OAuth device-code auth via `volt mcp auth-device <server>` and local/remote-safe RPC `start_mcp_server_auth` with `flow: "device"`, `poll_mcp_server_auth`, and `cancel_mcp_server_auth`.
- Logout/credential clearing via `volt mcp logout <server>` and local RPC `logout_mcp_server`.

Implemented since: first-class streaming auth events (`mcp_auth_request` / `mcp_auth_update`) for TUI/RPC/mobile via `mcp_events.v1`.

Still to do:

- Rich interactive `/mcp` auth UX beyond the lightweight command surface.

## Recommended decisions

1. Default mode is pure proxy.
2. Direct tools are available but off by default.
3. Volt writes only Volt-owned MCP config by default.
4. Project-local MCP config requires project trust.
5. Stdio servers get restricted env by default.
6. Mobile can manage existing trusted servers, not author arbitrary local commands by default.
7. Resources are explicit-read by default.
8. Prompts are user-preview by default.
9. All MCP metadata/results/resources/prompts are untrusted.
10. Large MCP outputs always use Volt truncation plus sidecar retrieval.
11. Session-owned MCP processes are the first product behavior; cross-session process sharing can be revisited later.

## Open questions

- Should OAuth token storage live in the existing Volt auth storage or a separate MCP token store?
- Should metadata discovery for cold lazy servers ever auto-start stdio servers, or should it require explicit refresh/connect?
- What is the exact mobile affordance for auth redirects on iOS?
- How should direct-tool token estimates be calculated consistently across providers?
- Should MCP audit logs be shown in the mobile app or only summarized as recent calls?
