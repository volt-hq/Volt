improvement(tui): Added negotiated [Sixel image rendering](https://volt-cli.dev/docs/terminal-setup/#windows-terminal) in Windows Terminal 1.22+, including fullscreen scrolling, cropping, and stale-image repainting.

Sixel output uses deterministic adaptive quantization with up to 256 colors for improved fidelity without dithering.
