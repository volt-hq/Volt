<goal name="iroh-saved-host-pairing">

<context>
This file is the operating manual and work ledger for a Volt /goal run that
implements one-time phone pairing followed by saved-host reconnect across app,
network, computer, and host-service restarts.

The paired root design document is `.volt/iroh-saved-host-pairing-design.md`;
treat that file as the cross-product SPEC. The iOS app handoff document is
`/Users/jordan.hans/Projects/volt-app/.volt/designs/iroh-saved-host-app-design.md`;
treat that file as the app-specific SPEC. This file is the TURN LEDGER. Update
the relevant SPEC document and this ledger when a queue item is resolved or when
implementation reveals a necessary design change.

Suggested goal prompt:
/goal Work through .volt/iroh-saved-host-pairing-goal.md, exactly one queue item
per goal turn, following the protocol in that file. Do not mark the goal complete
until every item in its work_queue has status="resolved". Commit only files
changed for the selected item, by explicit path, when committing is safe under
the repo rules; if commit authorization, target repo, branch, or ownership is
unclear, stop before committing and list the exact paths ready to stage.
</context>

<turn_definition>
A turn is one agent run from start until the final response is sent and the agent
becomes idle. Exactly ONE selectable work_queue item is worked per turn. If the
selected item finishes quickly, still stop after updating ledgers and committing
or stopping before commit when commit safety is unclear. Do not start another
item in the same turn.
</turn_definition>

<protocol>
  <step n="1" name="preflight">
    Run `git status --short` in `/Users/jordan.hans/Projects/Volt` and
    `git -C ../volt-app status --short`. Confirm dirty files are either expected
    setup files from working_tree_rules or in-progress files from a prior partial
    turn on the item you are about to re-select. If any other surprise dirty file
    exists, do not select an item: report the unexpected state and stop the turn.
  </step>

  <step n="2" name="select">
    Read the work_queue below. Select the FIRST item with status="open" whose
    prereq items, if any, all have status="resolved". Treat status="blocked" as
    not selectable. Items with type="rollup" are never selected directly; see
    rollup_rule. Work only the selected item this turn.
  </step>

  <step n="3" name="read_spec">
    Read `.volt/iroh-saved-host-pairing-design.md` and the selected item's
    relevant sections in full. If the selected item touches the iOS app, also read
    `/Users/jordan.hans/Projects/volt-app/.volt/designs/iroh-saved-host-app-design.md`.
    Also read current implementation files that own the behavior before editing
    them. Expected Volt host/protocol areas include:

    - `packages/coding-agent/src/core/remote/iroh/`
    - `packages/coding-agent/src/core/rpc/iroh-transport.ts`
    - `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/rpc/iroh-remote-rpc-mode.ts`
    - `packages/coding-agent/src/remote/iroh-host.mjs`
    - `packages/coding-agent/src/main.ts`
    - `packages/coding-agent/docs/iroh-remote-protocol.md`
    - `packages/coding-agent/docs/usage.md`
    - `packages/coding-agent/docs/security.md`
    - `packages/coding-agent/test/remote-iroh-core.test.ts`
    - `packages/coding-agent/test/remote-cli.test.ts`
    - `scripts/iroh-sidecar-test.mjs`

    Expected iOS app areas include:

    - `../volt-app/Packages/VoltClient/Sources/VoltClient/Transport/IrohTicket.swift`
    - `../volt-app/Packages/VoltClient/Sources/VoltClient/Transport/IrohVoltTransport.swift`
    - `../volt-app/Packages/VoltClient/Sources/VoltCore/SavedIrohTicket.swift`
    - `../volt-app/Packages/VoltClient/Sources/VoltCore/VoltSession.swift`
    - `../volt-app/Volt/SettingsView.swift`
    - `../volt-app/Packages/VoltClient/Tests/VoltClientTests/IrohTicketTests.swift`
    - `../volt-app/Packages/VoltClient/Tests/VoltClientTests/IrohVoltTransportIdentityTests.swift`
    - `../volt-app/Packages/VoltClient/Tests/VoltCoreTests/VoltSessionLifecycleTests.swift`

    Use LSP tools per &lt;lsp_usage/&gt; for semantic TypeScript questions before
    changing shared symbols. For Swift files, read/search directly and run Swift
    verification because Swift LSP may not be available.
  </step>

  <step n="4" name="implement">
    Implement the SPEC behavior faithfully for the selected item and add or
    extend tests that would have failed before the change and pass after it.
    Preserve the remote security boundary: one-time pairing secrets are never
    saved on the client, host state persists only secret hashes and non-secret
    metadata, existing paired clients reconnect by authoritative node ID, and
    clients cannot request arbitrary host paths or tools.

    type="decision" items: make the decision explicitly, record it in the
    relevant SPEC document and this ledger, and implement only the docs/tests/code
    needed by that decision in the same turn. A defer/keep decision counts as
    resolving the item only if it includes enough rationale and acceptance notes
    for a future implementer.
  </step>

  <step n="5" name="verify">
    After editing TypeScript files, run `lsp.diagnostics` on each changed TS/TSX
    file and fix reported diagnostics before launching slower verification. Then
    run the commands in &lt;verification/&gt; that apply to changed files. All required
    checks for changed files must pass before the item may be marked resolved. If
    native Iroh behavior, iOS hardware, relay environment, or product input is
    unavailable, follow blocked_rule or partial_progress_rule instead of
    overclaiming.
  </step>

  <step n="6" name="update_ledgers">
    All dates in both ledgers use YYYY-MM-DD format.

    `.volt/iroh-saved-host-pairing-design.md`: update relevant sections with
    `Resolved YYYY-MM-DD:` plus the concrete behavior or decision when an item is
    resolved.

    `/Users/jordan.hans/Projects/volt-app/.volt/designs/iroh-saved-host-app-design.md`:
    update app-specific sections when the selected item changes app behavior or
    app-specific decisions.

    This file: set the selected item status="resolved" and fill its
    &lt;evidence&gt; with one concise line containing what changed, what verification
    ran, and the commit SHA when a commit was made. For partial progress, follow
    partial_progress_rule instead.
  </step>

  <step n="7" name="commit">
    If committing is safe and authorized under the repo rules, stage only files
    changed for the selected item, by explicit path. Never use `git add -A` or
    `git add .`.

    If the selected item changes both `/Users/jordan.hans/Projects/Volt` and
    `../volt-app`, commit them separately in their respective repositories unless
    the user requested otherwise. Ask before committing or pushing if scope,
    target branch, remote, or ownership is unclear.

    Suggested commit message formats:
    Volt host/protocol: `fix(coding-agent): support saved Iroh hosts &lt;ref&gt;`
    Volt docs/decision: `docs(coding-agent): record saved Iroh host decision &lt;ref&gt;`
    iOS app: `fix: support saved Iroh host reconnect &lt;ref&gt;`
    iOS tests/docs: `test: cover saved Iroh host reconnect &lt;ref&gt;`

    If not committing, leave the item status open unless the user explicitly
    accepts non-committed ledger updates; report the exact paths ready to stage
    and stop.
  </step>

  <step n="8" name="stop">
    Summarize what changed and what verification ran, then end the turn.

  <notes>
    `npm run check` is required after Volt code changes and must be run from the
    Volt repo root. If a test file is created or modified, run the specific test
    file and iterate until it passes before broader checks. For iOS simulator
    verification, if the named simulator is unavailable, choose an available iOS
    simulator and record the exact destination used. Prefer XcodeBuildMCP
    simulator tools when configured; otherwise use the xcodebuild command above.
  </notes>

<lsp_usage>
Volt has LSP tools available through the `lsp` tool with actions such as
`definition`, `references`, `hover`, `symbols`, `diagnostics`, `rename`, and
`fix`. Prefer LSP over grep/read whenever the question is semantic: who calls
this, where is this symbol defined, what type is this, or what breaks if this
signature changes.

Per-turn usage:

- Use `lsp.symbols` to locate relevant TypeScript symbols when the file is not
  obvious.
- Before changing a shared TS symbol's behavior or signature, call
  `lsp.references`; every caller is potentially a behavior or test surface that
  must be considered in the same turn.
- For renames, use `lsp.rename`, not find-and-replace.
- After editing, run `lsp.diagnostics` on each changed TS/TSX file.
- `.mjs`, `.cjs`, Markdown, shell scripts, and Swift files may not have semantic
  LSP coverage; read/search those files directly and mention that fallback in
  evidence when relevant.
</lsp_usage>

<working_tree_rules>
This setup turn may leave these planning files uncommitted until the user decides
whether to commit them:

- `.volt/iroh-saved-host-pairing-design.md`
- `.volt/iroh-saved-host-pairing-goal.md`
- `/Users/jordan.hans/Projects/volt-app/.volt/designs/iroh-saved-host-app-design.md`

The `../volt-app/.volt/` directory is ignored by that repository. Treat the app
design file as a local planning artifact unless the user changes the app repo
ignore policy.

Expected out-of-scope dirty files during saved-host-pairing turns: none beyond
the planning files above. Multiple Volt sessions may share the same worktrees.
Never stage or commit files you did not modify for the selected item. If either
repository shows unrelated dirty files beyond the allowances above, stop before
selecting work.
</working_tree_rules>

<partial_progress_rule>
If the selected item is too large to finish in one turn but coherent progress is
possible, this is not a block. Work only that item, keep it status="open", add a
`&lt;progress date="YYYY-MM-DD"&gt;` child describing what changed and what remains,
run verification required for the files changed, and commit only coherent
completed progress if committing is safe and authorized. The next turn will
re-select this same item because it remains the first selectable open item.
</partial_progress_rule>

<rollup_rule>
Items with type="rollup" are never selected directly. When a turn resolves the
final prerequisite of a rollup item, mark the rollup resolved in this file and
update the design doc checklist during that same turn. Do not spend a separate
turn on a rollup item.
</rollup_rule>

<blocked_rule>
If the selected item cannot proceed at all, or its remaining portion cannot
proceed because required evidence, credentials, a supported platform, a simulator,
a real iOS device, native Iroh support, a relay environment, or a human product
decision is unavailable:

1. Do whatever portion is achievable without the blocker, following
   partial_progress_rule.
2. Add a `Blocked YYYY-MM-DD:` note to the relevant SPEC document and set this
   file's item status="blocked" with a `&lt;blocker&gt;` child explaining what is
   needed.
3. Stop the turn. Later turns do not select blocked items unless the blocker is
   plausibly cleared.
4. Mark the overall goal blocked only when no selectable open item remains.
</blocked_rule>

<completion_rule>
Do not declare the goal complete until every work_queue item has status="resolved",
the rollup item is resolved, and final required verification passed. Final
evidence must include at least one native Iroh saved-host reconnect smoke and one
iOS app saved-host reconnect smoke, or explicitly document why that evidence is
blocked.
</completion_rule>
