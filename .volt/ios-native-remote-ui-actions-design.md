# iOS Native Remote UI Actions Design

## Status

Proposed.

## Purpose

Define the long-term architecture for bringing Volt's interactive TUI capabilities into the iOS app without mirroring terminal rendering. The target is a native iOS interface that exposes the same useful capabilities as slash commands, selectors, settings panes, model controls, review workflows, and extension UI, while keeping the wire protocol typed, remote-safe, and stable.

This document focuses on the host/app contract for native action surfaces such as cards, buttons, command palettes, and settings controls. It intentionally treats slash commands as one presentation of host actions rather than the protocol itself.

## Context

Volt currently has three overlapping interaction surfaces:

1. **Interactive TUI**
   - Built-in slash commands are handled inside `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/interactive/interactive-mode.ts`.
   - Examples: `/review`, `/model`, `/settings`, `/compact`, `/clear`, `/resume`, `/tree`, `/login`, `/extensions`.
   - The TUI also provides autocomplete, selectors, custom extension UI, status/footer widgets, and keyboard shortcuts.

2. **Core agent/session APIs**
   - `AgentSession` owns session state, prompt dispatch, extension command dispatch, prompt-template expansion, skill expansion, compaction, model switching, session switching, and extension binding.
   - Extension slash commands, prompt templates, and skills are already available outside the TUI when invoked through `AgentSession.prompt()`.

3. **RPC and Iroh remote access**
   - RPC exposes typed commands such as `prompt`, `get_state`, `get_transcript`, `new_session`, `list_sessions`, `switch_session_by_id`, and `abort`.
   - Non-remote RPC also exposes richer local commands such as `get_commands`, `get_available_models`, `set_model`, `compact`, `bash`, and `export_html`.
   - Iroh remote access deliberately narrows direct inbound RPC commands for mobile safety.
   - The iOS app already renders transcript, connection state, session list, and extension UI notifications/dialog cancellation paths using native Swift views.

The current RPC contract can already invoke extension commands, skills, and prompt templates by sending a prompt whose text starts with `/`. For example:

```json
{"type":"prompt","message":"/skill:pi-goal-writer draft a goal"}
```

That is useful as a compatibility path, but it is not the right long-term API for native mobile UI. The iOS app should not need to know that a review workflow is spelled `/review uncommitted`, nor should it need to understand provider-specific model tuning for a "Fast mode" button.

## Problem

A native iOS app needs user-facing controls that do not map cleanly to raw slash-command text:

- Cards such as **Review changes**, **Review PR**, **Summarize session**, **Compact context**, or **New conversation**.
- Toggles such as **Fast mode**, **Deep reasoning**, **Plan mode**, or **Read-only mode**.
- Pickers such as model selection, thinking level, session resume, workspace selection, and extension-provided choices.
- One-tap workflows that internally reuse existing slash command behavior, but should remain stable even if the slash syntax changes.
- Capability-aware UI where the host tells the app which actions are available, enabled, remote-safe, and currently active.

Sending raw slash commands over RPC has several shortcomings:

- It conflates UI presentation with execution semantics.
- Built-in TUI slash commands do not currently execute in RPC mode.
- Remote clients cannot safely discover all local metadata because current `get_commands` includes source paths and excludes built-in TUI commands.
- A raw string gives the app no structured information about arguments, enabled state, destructive behavior, icon/category, current toggle state, or required confirmation.
- iOS could become coupled to TUI implementation details and command names.
- Extension command completion and built-in command flows may require UI requests that are not represented in a raw command string.

## Core Principle

Do not remote-control the terminal TUI. Remote-control Volt's intent model.

The host owns capabilities and execution. The iOS app owns native presentation. Slash commands, buttons, cards, toggles, and menu rows are different presentations of the same host-owned action graph.

## Product Model

The iOS app should eventually expose a native **Actions** or **Command Center** page with cards and controls such as:

- Review uncommitted changes
- Review staged changes
- Review current branch
- Compact conversation
- Start new conversation
- Resume previous session
- Toggle Fast mode
- Toggle high reasoning
- Switch model
- Reload extensions/prompts/skills
- Run extension commands
- Invoke skills
- Apply prompt templates

The user should not need to learn slash syntax to use these. Advanced users can still use a slash-command palette or type slash commands in the editor.

Example native card behavior:

- User taps **Review changes**.
- iOS sends `invoke_ui_action` with action id `review.uncommitted`.
- Host runs the same review implementation that the TUI currently reaches through `/review uncommitted`.
- If the action needs choices or confirmation, the host emits typed UI requests and the app renders native dialogs.
- Transcript and state update through existing event and transcript surfaces.

Example native toggle behavior:

- Host exposes `thinking.fast_mode` with current state `off`, enabled `true`, and display text "Fast mode".
- User toggles it on.
- iOS sends `invoke_ui_action` with action id `thinking.fast_mode` and `{ "enabled": true }`.
- Host lowers the current session thinking level when that is supported by the current model.
- iOS updates from subsequent `ui_action_state_changed`, `get_state`, or action-list refresh data.

## Goals

- Expose remote-safe host capabilities as typed actions instead of raw slash command strings.
- Let iOS render native cards, buttons, toggles, pickers, command palettes, and detail sheets.
- Preserve existing TUI slash commands as a presentation layer.
- Reuse existing core session/action logic where possible.
- Support built-in actions, extension commands, prompt templates, skills, and future extension-provided action cards.
- Keep host-local paths, source metadata, raw transcripts, provider internals, and sensitive extension data out of the mobile protocol.
- Make availability and enabled state host-authoritative.
- Give the app enough metadata to build a polished UI without hardcoding provider-specific or workflow-specific logic.
- Provide a phased migration path from current RPC commands to a shared action registry.

## Non-goals

- Do not stream terminal drawing operations or ANSI/TUI component trees to iOS.
- Do not require iOS to implement the terminal TUI layout engine.
- Do not expose unrestricted local RPC commands over Iroh.
- Do not make iOS parse or own provider-specific model-selection policy.
- Do not expose raw `get_messages`, raw session files, or full host source paths.
- Do not require every TUI-only feature to become remote-safe in the first phase.
- Do not break existing RPC clients that invoke extension commands through `prompt`.

## Desired Long-Term Architecture

### Host-Owned Action Registry

Introduce a shared action registry used by TUI, RPC, Iroh remote, SDK/in-process clients, and future desktop/mobile UIs.

Each action should define:

- Stable `id`, such as `review.uncommitted` or `thinking.fast_mode`.
- Human label and description.
- Source: `builtin`, `extension`, `prompt`, `skill`, or `package`.
- Optional slash alias, such as `review` or `skill:foo`.
- Optional argument schema.
- Optional argument completions.
- Availability and enabled-state logic.
- Optional state for toggles or selected values.
- Remote-safety classification.
- Presentation hints for native UIs.
- Execution handler.

The registry should become the source of truth for interactive command availability. The TUI command parser can call the same action handlers that RPC/iOS invoke by id.

### Native iOS Presentation

The iOS app renders host actions as native views. The host may provide presentation hints, but the app decides exact layout.

Presentation kinds:

- `card`: prominent action card.
- `button`: compact button row.
- `toggle`: boolean or enum state control.
- `picker`: action that opens a host-backed or app-backed selector.
- `palette`: searchable command item.
- `detail`: action with a form or secondary page.
- `hidden`: invokable only by explicit id or deep link, not shown by default.

Example UI grouping:

- Review
- Session
- Model
- Context
- Extensions
- Skills
- Advanced

The app can curate high-value cards while still falling back to host-provided palette entries for less common actions.

### Typed RPC Action Layer

Add a remote UI/action layer on top of existing RPC JSONL.

Core commands:

```json
{"type":"get_ui_capabilities"}
```

```json
{"type":"get_ui_actions","scope":"primary"}
```

```json
{"type":"invoke_ui_action","action":"review.uncommitted","args":{}}
```

```json
{"type":"get_ui_action_completions","action":"review.pr","argument":"target","prefix":"https://"}
```

Core events:

```json
{"type":"ui_actions_changed"}
```

```json
{"type":"ui_action_state_changed","action":"thinking.fast_mode","state":{"value":"on"}}
```

The first implementation can be much smaller, but the protocol should be designed so the iOS app can evolve without needing new hardcoded routes for every TUI feature.

## Resolved 2026-06-23: Initial Action Scope and Remote Allowlist

A.1 decision: the first native action phase is a discovery and prompt-like invocation layer, not a broad projection of every TUI slash command or local RPC command.

Implementation evidence reviewed for this decision:

- Built-in TUI slash names are declared in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/slash-commands.ts` and handled in `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/interactive/interactive-mode.ts`.
- Headless RPC commands and responses are declared in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/rpc/types.ts` and dispatched in `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/rpc/rpc-mode.ts`.
- Iroh remote currently forwards only `prompt`, `steer`, `follow_up`, `abort`, `new_session`, `get_state`, `get_transcript`, `list_sessions`, `switch_session_by_id`, and `extension_ui_response`.
- Current local `get_commands` returns extension commands, prompt templates, and skills with `sourceInfo`, including host-local paths. It remains blocked over Iroh.
- `AgentSession.prompt()` already executes extension commands and expands skills/templates on the host. Remote clients can currently invoke those only by sending raw slash text through `prompt`.

Initial Iroh action additions:

- `get_ui_capabilities` and `get_ui_actions` may be allowed over Iroh in the discovery phase after descriptor sanitization exists.
- `invoke_ui_action` may be allowed over Iroh only after invocation-time reauthorization and action-level remote-safety checks exist.
- The first remotely invokable action ids are limited to projected extension commands, prompt templates, and skills. They must execute through host-owned `AgentSession.prompt()` or equivalent host expansion, never client-side expansion.
- Raw `get_commands`, `get_messages`, path-based `switch_session`, unrestricted model listing/selection, local bash/export commands, extension source paths, prompt bodies, and skill contents stay blocked remotely.

### Built-In Slash Command Classification

| Slash command | Current RPC equivalent | Classification | A.1 decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/settings` | none | local-only | TUI settings UI stays local. Native settings need separate host-owned descriptors later. |
| `/profile` | none | deferred pending policy | Profile switching can reload resources and model defaults; defer until profile semantics are action-owned. |
| `/model` | `set_model`, `get_available_models`, `cycle_model` local RPC only | deferred pending policy | Full model metadata and model switching stay blocked over Iroh. |
| `/scoped-models` | none | local-only | Scoped model editor is TUI/settings UI and is not a first-phase remote action. |
| `/export` | `export_html` local RPC only | local-only | Writes host files and returns paths; not remote-safe for v1 actions. |
| `/import` | none | local-only | Host-path session import is not remote-safe. |
| `/share` | none | deferred pending policy | Creates an external gist and needs explicit confirmation/audit policy. |
| `/copy` | `get_last_assistant_text` local RPC only | unsupported remote | Clipboard action is app-local; raw last-message RPC remains blocked over Iroh. |
| `/name` | `set_session_name` local RPC only | deferred pending registry | Safe candidate for later `session.rename`, but not in the first action subset. |
| `/session` | `get_state`, `get_session_stats` local RPC for full stats | local-only as action | iOS should use state/session data sources, not a command card. |
| `/lsp` | none | local-only | LSP status/restart/trace can expose host paths and process state. |
| `/changelog` | none | unsupported remote | App release notes should be app-owned or documented separately. |
| `/hotkeys` | none | unsupported remote | Keyboard help is TUI-local. |
| `/fork` | `fork`, `get_fork_messages` local RPC only | deferred pending policy | Exposes message text and mutates session tree; requires a native session/tree design. |
| `/clone` | `clone` local RPC only | deferred pending policy | Session mutation candidate after shared registry and stale-state checks. |
| `/tree` | none | deferred pending policy | Branch tree, summaries, and selectors need a separate data model. |
| `/trust` | none | local-only | Project trust is a security decision and remains host-local until explicitly designed. |
| `/store` | none | local-only | Extension package install/remove/update is a host mutation surface. |
| `/extensions` | none | local-only | Extension management may expose paths and package policy; defer. |
| `/login` | none | local-only | Provider auth and secrets stay local. |
| `/logout` | none | local-only | Provider auth mutation stays local. |
| `/clear` | `new_session` remote-allowed RPC | initial remote-safe existing RPC | Keep existing native new-session flow; add `session.new` action only after the shared registry scaffold. |
| `/compact` | `compact` local RPC only | deferred pending policy | Compaction uses model auth, mutates context, and can abort active work; defer until shared action policy. |
| `/review` | none | deferred pending registry | Not in the first discovery subset. A.5 resolves remote-native review exposure to `review.uncommitted` and `review.branch` after shared action handlers exist. |
| `/resume` | `list_sessions`, `switch_session_by_id` remote-allowed RPC | initial remote-safe existing RPC | Keep existing native session list/switch flow; action projection waits for the shared registry. |
| `/reload` | none | local-only | Reloads keybindings, extensions, skills, prompts, and themes; remote policy is not defined. |
| `/quit` | none | unsupported remote | Remote detach is transport close; host shutdown is not a mobile action. |

Unregistered developer or easter-egg handlers in `interactive-mode.ts` such as `/debug`, `/arminsayshi`, and `/dementedelves` are unsupported and must not appear in native action descriptors.

### Existing RPC Surface Classification

| RPC group | Commands | Iroh/action decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prompt compatibility | `prompt`, `steer`, `follow_up` | Already remote allowed. Remains the fallback path and the internal execution path for first-phase prompt-like actions. |
| Cancellation | `abort` | Already remote allowed. Future `run.cancel` can wrap it after shared registry work. |
| Session basics | `new_session`, `get_state`, `get_transcript`, `list_sessions`, `switch_session_by_id` | Already remote allowed. Continue using these as native data/control flows before action projection. |
| Extension UI | `extension_ui_response` | Already remote allowed as the response path for host-owned UI requests. |
| Model/thinking | `set_model`, `cycle_model`, `get_available_models`, `set_thinking_level`, `cycle_thinking_level` | Direct RPC stays local-only over Iroh. A.4 allows only the narrower future `thinking.fast_mode` action after shared action authorization exists. |
| Context/settings/retry | `compact`, `set_auto_compaction`, `set_auto_retry`, `abort_retry` | Local-only for now; remote actions need shared handlers and state semantics. |
| Local tools/export/raw data | `bash`, `abort_bash`, `export_html`, `get_messages`, `get_last_assistant_text` | Remain blocked remotely. |
| Session internals | `switch_session`, `fork`, `clone`, `get_fork_messages`, `get_session_stats`, `set_session_name` | Local-only unless a later action explicitly sanitizes data and rechecks state. |
| Command discovery | `get_commands` | Replace remotely with sanitized `get_ui_actions`; do not allow raw `get_commands` over Iroh. |

### Dynamic Command Source Classification

| Source | Current behavior | Classification | A.1 decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Extension commands | `volt.registerCommand()` provides name, description, completions, handler, and source metadata. Duplicate names receive invocation suffixes. | initial remote-safe with sanitized descriptors | Project as palette actions without source paths. Invoke by action id only after B.5 reauthorization. |
| Prompt templates | Markdown templates provide name, description, optional argument hint, body, source info, and file path. Host expands arguments. | initial remote-safe with sanitized descriptors | Project as palette actions. Descriptors omit template body and host paths; host expands on invocation. |
| Skills | Loaded skills provide name, description, file path, base directory, source info, and full skill body read at expansion time. | initial remote-safe with sanitized descriptors | Project as palette actions when host policy enables them. Descriptors omit body, file path, and base directory; host expands on invocation. |
| Future extension native cards | No API yet. | deferred pending policy | E.3 decides whether to add `registerAction()` or keep command projection only. |

### Review and Fast Mode First-Phase Decisions

Review actions are deferred from the first discovery phase. Current `/review` runs git or `gh`, may prompt for target/tool choices, uses review-model policy, runs an isolated agent session, and then starts a fresh session with findings. A.5 resolves the first native review card set as a narrow remote-safe subset plus local-only/deferred review targets.

Fast mode is deferred from the first discovery phase. Current model and thinking RPC commands are local-only over Iroh. A.4 resolves the first native model-speed action as the narrower `thinking.fast_mode` substitute described below.

## Action Descriptor Shape

### Resolved 2026-06-23: V1 Descriptor Schema, Ids, and Compatibility

A.2 decision: v1 uses a small custom descriptor schema. Built-in action ids are stable and semantic. Projected extension commands, prompt templates, and skills use session-local opaque ids for v1. Future extension-provided native actions may add stable extension-owned ids only after E.3 defines registration, trust, and compatibility rules.

Normative v1 TypeScript shape:

```ts
type UiActionSource = "builtin" | "extension" | "prompt" | "skill" | "package";
type UiActionCategory = "review" | "session" | "model" | "context" | "extension" | "prompt" | "skill" | "advanced";
type UiActionPresentationKind = "card" | "button" | "toggle" | "picker" | "palette" | "detail" | "hidden";
type UiActionArgumentType = "string" | "boolean" | "enum" | "integer";
type UiActionStateType = "boolean" | "string" | "enum" | "integer";
type UiActionStreamingBehavior = "disabled" | "immediate" | "queueSteer" | "queueFollowUp";
type UiActionScalar = string | number | boolean | null;

interface UiActionDescriptor {
  schemaVersion: 1;
  id: string;
  label: string;
  description?: string;
  source: UiActionSource;
  sourceScope?: "user" | "project" | "temporary";
  sourceOrigin?: "package" | "top-level";
  sourceLabel?: string;
  category: UiActionCategory | string;
  presentation?: UiActionPresentationHint;
  args?: UiActionArgumentDescriptor[];
  state?: UiActionStateDescriptor;
  enabled: boolean;
  disabledReason?: string | null;
  destructive?: boolean;
  requiresConfirmation?: boolean;
  streamingBehavior?: UiActionStreamingBehavior | UiActionStreamingBehavior[];
  remoteSafe: boolean;
  slash?: UiActionSlashAlias;
}

interface UiActionPresentationHint {
  kind: UiActionPresentationKind | string;
  group?: string;
  priority?: number;
  icon?: string;
}

interface UiActionArgumentDescriptor {
  name: string;
  label?: string;
  description?: string;
  type: UiActionArgumentType;
  required?: boolean;
  multiline?: boolean;
  placeholder?: string;
  hint?: string;
  defaultValue?: UiActionScalar;
  options?: Array<{ value: string; label?: string; description?: string }>;
  completion?: "commandArguments" | string;
}

interface UiActionStateDescriptor {
  type: UiActionStateType | string;
  value: UiActionScalar;
  label?: string;
  options?: Array<{ value: string; label?: string; description?: string }>;
}

interface UiActionSlashAlias {
  name: string;
  example?: string;
}
```

Field rules:

- `schemaVersion` is required and must be `1` for this contract.
- `id`, `label`, `source`, `category`, `enabled`, and `remoteSafe` are required.
- `description`, labels, hints, group names, icon names, and disabled reasons are display strings. They must be bounded by host-side descriptor limits and must not include source paths or secrets.
- `sourceScope`, `sourceOrigin`, and `sourceLabel` are optional sanitized provenance. They are replacements for raw `SourceInfo`, not a direct projection of it.
- `presentation` is a hint. Unknown `presentation.kind` values must render as a palette/list item or be ignored.
- `args` describes the data shape the app may collect. The first implementation may support only a single optional string argument, but descriptors should use this shape so later forms remain compatible.
- `state` is a display snapshot for toggles, pickers, or selected values. Host state remains authoritative and must be refreshed after invocation, reconnect, or `ui_action_state_changed`.
- `destructive` and `requiresConfirmation` default to `false` when omitted. The host may still require confirmation or reject an action at invocation time.
- `streamingBehavior` describes what the host may do if the action is invoked while an agent turn is already streaming. Omitted means `disabled`. Multiple values mean the client may select between allowed queue modes when invoking.
- `remoteSafe` describes whether the action may be shown to a remote client after filtering. It is not an authorization grant.
- `slash` is an alias/presentation hint only. Clients must not treat slash text as the canonical action id.

Id rules:

- Built-in ids are stable, semantic, lower-case, dot-separated ids such as `session.new`, `run.cancel`, `context.compact`, `session.rename`, `review.uncommitted`, or `thinking.fast_mode`. Once shipped, a built-in id must not be reused for a different behavior. Breaking behavior requires a new id.
- V1 projected extension command ids are session-local opaque ids under the `extension.command.` prefix, for example `extension.command.ec_7f3k2q`. They are derived from the current host action catalog, not from raw source paths.
- V1 projected prompt template ids are session-local opaque ids under the `prompt.template.` prefix, for example `prompt.template.pt_4v9m1x`.
- V1 projected skill ids are session-local opaque ids under the `skill.` prefix, for example `skill.sk_8k2p0d`.
- Dynamic ids are valid only for the action list/revision that returned them. Clients must not persist them across reconnect, session switch, reload, project trust change, or host restart. After any refresh trigger, clients must discard old dynamic ids and use the latest descriptors.
- The human slash alias and display label may remain stable while the action id changes. Invocation must use `id`, not `slash.name`.
- Stable extension-owned ids are deferred until `volt.registerAction()` or an equivalent first-class action API defines package identity, project trust, collision handling, and migration semantics.

Compatibility rules:

- Clients must ignore unknown descriptor fields.
- Clients should skip descriptors missing required fields or containing invalid required field types.
- Clients must tolerate unknown `source`, `category`, `presentation.kind`, argument type, and state type values. Unknown categories render in an advanced/other group; unknown presentation kinds render as palette rows; unknown argument types make the action non-invokable from generated forms.
- Clients must ignore unknown `streamingBehavior` values. If no known streaming behavior remains and the agent is streaming, the action should render disabled until actions refresh.
- Hosts must reject unknown, stale, disabled, unauthorized, or not-remote-safe action ids at invocation time with the normal RPC error shape.
- Descriptors are advisory snapshots. Hosts must re-check availability, streaming state, project trust, remote policy, and authorization when `invoke_ui_action` is received.
- Hosts may omit actions that are unavailable, unsafe, too large, or unsupported by the requesting client capabilities.
- Additive fields and enum values do not require a new protocol version. Removing required fields, changing required field meanings, or changing invocation semantics requires a new capability or schema version.
- Remote descriptors must never include `sourceInfo.path`, `baseDir`, `filePath`, prompt template `content`, full skill content, raw package install paths, provider secrets, environment values, auth internals, raw model/provider metadata, raw transcript payloads, or host session file paths.

Example descriptor:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "review.uncommitted",
  "label": "Review changes",
  "description": "Review uncommitted workspace changes for bugs and regressions.",
  "source": "builtin",
  "category": "review",
  "presentation": {
    "kind": "card",
    "priority": 100,
    "icon": "magnifyingglass",
    "group": "Review"
  },
  "slash": {
    "name": "review",
    "example": "/review uncommitted"
  },
  "enabled": true,
  "disabledReason": null,
  "destructive": false,
  "requiresConfirmation": true,
  "streamingBehavior": "disabled",
  "remoteSafe": true,
  "args": []
}
```

Built-in action ids should be stable and semantic. Dynamic source action ids should be opaque and session-local. No action id should include display labels, localized text, file paths, or extension source paths.

### Built-in Sources

Built-in examples:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "session.new",
  "label": "New conversation",
  "source": "builtin",
  "category": "session",
  "presentation": { "kind": "button", "group": "Session" },
  "slash": { "name": "clear", "example": "/clear" },
  "enabled": true,
  "requiresConfirmation": true,
  "remoteSafe": true
}
```

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "context.compact",
  "label": "Compact context",
  "source": "builtin",
  "category": "context",
  "presentation": { "kind": "card", "group": "Context" },
  "slash": { "name": "compact", "example": "/compact" },
  "enabled": true,
  "remoteSafe": false,
  "args": [
    {
      "name": "customInstructions",
      "label": "Custom instructions",
      "type": "string",
      "required": false,
      "multiline": true
    }
  ]
}
```

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "review.pr",
  "label": "Review PR",
  "source": "builtin",
  "category": "review",
  "presentation": { "kind": "card", "group": "Review" },
  "slash": { "name": "review", "example": "/review pr <url>" },
  "enabled": false,
  "disabledReason": "GitHub credential and network policy is not remote-safe yet.",
  "requiresConfirmation": true,
  "remoteSafe": false,
  "args": [
    {
      "name": "target",
      "label": "PR URL or number",
      "type": "string",
      "required": true,
      "placeholder": "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Extension Command Sources

Extension commands can be projected as actions:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "extension.command.ec_7f3k2q",
  "label": "Deploy",
  "description": "Deploy to an environment",
  "source": "extension",
  "sourceScope": "project",
  "sourceOrigin": "package",
  "sourceLabel": "deploy-tools",
  "category": "extension",
  "presentation": { "kind": "palette", "group": "Extensions" },
  "slash": { "name": "deploy", "example": "/deploy" },
  "enabled": true,
  "remoteSafe": true,
  "args": [
    {
      "name": "arguments",
      "type": "string",
      "required": false,
      "completion": "commandArguments"
    }
  ]
}
```

Remote projection must not include host-local `sourceInfo.path` by default. If provenance is useful, expose only sanitized `sourceScope`, `sourceOrigin`, and `sourceLabel` fields.

### Prompt Template Sources

Prompt templates can become actions whose execution sends the expanded prompt:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "prompt.template.pt_4v9m1x",
  "label": "review",
  "description": "Review staged git changes",
  "source": "prompt",
  "sourceScope": "project",
  "sourceOrigin": "top-level",
  "category": "prompt",
  "presentation": { "kind": "palette", "group": "Prompts" },
  "slash": { "name": "review", "example": "/review" },
  "enabled": true,
  "remoteSafe": true,
  "args": [
    {
      "name": "arguments",
      "label": "Arguments",
      "type": "string",
      "required": false,
      "hint": "<PR-URL>"
    }
  ]
}
```

The host should perform template expansion. iOS should not fetch or interpret template body content.

### Skill Sources

Skills can become actions that inject the skill content through existing skill expansion:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "skill.sk_8k2p0d",
  "label": "pi-goal-writer",
  "description": "Drafts and reviews strong /goal objectives.",
  "source": "skill",
  "sourceScope": "user",
  "sourceOrigin": "top-level",
  "category": "skill",
  "presentation": { "kind": "palette", "group": "Skills" },
  "slash": { "name": "skill:pi-goal-writer", "example": "/skill:pi-goal-writer" },
  "enabled": true,
  "remoteSafe": true,
  "args": [
    {
      "name": "instructions",
      "type": "string",
      "required": false,
      "multiline": true
    }
  ]
}
```

As with prompt templates, the host expands the skill. The remote descriptor should not include `filePath` or `baseDir` unless explicitly allowed and sanitized.

## Invocation Response Semantics

`invoke_ui_action` response data reports the command disposition, not necessarily final workflow completion. Prompt-like actions keep the existing `prompt` contract: the RPC response means the host accepted the request after preflight, and the normal agent event stream reports the turn lifecycle.

Request shape:

```ts
interface InvokeUiActionCommand {
  action: string;
  args?: Record<string, unknown>;
  streamingBehavior?: "steer" | "followUp";
}
```

Response data shape:

```ts
type UiActionInvocationStatus =
  | "accepted"
  | "completed"
  | "queued"
  | "handled"
  | "cancelled";

interface UiActionInvocationResponse {
  action: string;
  status: UiActionInvocationStatus;
  queuedAs?: "steer" | "followUp";
  state?: UiActionStateDescriptor;
  stateChanged?: boolean;
  actionsChanged?: boolean;
  message?: string;
}
```

Example accepted response:

```json
{
  "id": "req-1",
  "type": "response",
  "command": "invoke_ui_action",
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "action": "review.uncommitted",
    "status": "accepted"
  }
}
```

Possible statuses:

- `accepted`: a prompt-like action was accepted while idle and will produce normal agent events. iOS should enter or keep streaming UI state and clear action pending state only when the turn reaches `agent_end`, fails, or the connection recovery path replaces the session state.
- `queued`: a prompt-like action was accepted while another turn is streaming. `queuedAs` names whether the host queued it as a `steer` or `followUp`. iOS should clear the tap/send pending spinner on the response, keep the current streaming state, and rely on `queue_update` plus later agent events for queue visibility and completion.
- `completed`: the action finished synchronously and no agent events are expected. iOS should clear pending UI immediately and apply any returned state or refresh hints.
- `handled`: the host, an extension command, or an input hook handled the action without starting an agent turn. No `agent_end` is expected; iOS should clear pending UI immediately.
- `cancelled`: the action was cancelled before execution by the user, host, or extension. No `agent_end` is expected; iOS should clear pending UI immediately.

Only `accepted` and `queued` may require waiting for later agent events after the RPC response. `completed`, `handled`, and `cancelled` are terminal for the invocation response itself. Clients must not use a `promptAndWait`-style `agent_end` wait for terminal synchronous statuses because extension/input-hook handling can intentionally produce no agent turn.

Synchronous state actions return `completed` with `stateChanged`, `actionsChanged`, or bounded response data when useful. If the response says actions changed, iOS should refresh `get_ui_actions`; if it says state changed, iOS should refresh `get_state` unless the response already contains the new state shape for the specific action.

While the agent is streaming, the host rechecks the current action descriptor and handler policy before invocation:

- `disabled`: reject with a normal RPC error.
- `immediate`: execute now and return `completed`, `handled`, or `cancelled`.
- `queueSteer`: enqueue as steering and return `queued` with `queuedAs: "steer"`.
- `queueFollowUp`: enqueue as a follow-up and return `queued` with `queuedAs: "followUp"`.

If a descriptor allows both queue modes, the optional `streamingBehavior` request field selects the mode. If a prompt-like action has no streaming policy and the agent is already streaming, the host rejects it instead of guessing.

The host must never trust cached client availability. On every invocation it resolves the action id against the current registry, applies the Iroh/local allowlist, validates arguments, rechecks `enabled`, `remoteSafe`, trust, session state, and streaming policy, then executes the current handler. Unknown, stale, disabled, local-only, or disallowed actions fail with the normal RPC error shape even if an older descriptor advertised them as enabled.

Errors should use normal RPC error shape:

```json
{
  "id": "req-1",
  "type": "response",
  "command": "invoke_ui_action",
  "success": false,
  "error": "Action not available while the agent is streaming"
}
```

Expected later tests:

- `B.1` RPC shape tests cover parsing `invoke_ui_action` request fields and serializing all five status values.
- `B.4` host tests cover idle prompt-like `accepted`, streaming `queued` steer/follow-up, immediate `handled`, synchronous `completed`, `cancelled`, stale id rejection, disabled action rejection, and invocation-time enabled rechecks.
- `B.5` Iroh tests cover remote allowlist rejection and confirm synchronous responses do not wait for `agent_end` before remote command completion.
- `C.4` iOS tests cover `accepted` waiting for `agent_end`, `queued` preserving current streaming/queue UI, terminal synchronous statuses clearing pending UI immediately, and RPC errors clearing pending UI with a system-visible error.

## Slash Commands as Presentation

Slash commands should become one view over the action registry.

TUI behavior:

- User types `/review uncommitted`.
- TUI parser resolves slash name and arguments to `review.uncommitted`.
- The shared action handler runs.

RPC/iOS behavior:

- User taps **Review changes**.
- iOS sends `invoke_ui_action` for `review.uncommitted`.
- The same shared action handler runs.

Advanced fallback:

- User types `/skill:foo args` in the iOS prompt editor.
- iOS may send existing `prompt` text for compatibility.
- Later, iOS can resolve slash text against `get_ui_actions` and invoke by action id when possible.

This keeps slash commands useful without making slash text the canonical remote protocol.

## Fast Mode Design

Fast mode should be a host-owned policy action, not an iOS hardcoded provider map.

### Resolved 2026-06-23: Fast Mode Policy Boundary

A.4 decision: full `model.fast_mode` is deferred. The v1 model-speed action is `thinking.fast_mode`, a session-local toggle that only changes the current session's thinking level. It never switches models, changes scoped model lists, edits profile/global defaults, or exposes model catalog metadata.

`thinking.fast_mode` may be exposed to iOS over Iroh after the shared action registry and `invoke_ui_action` remote allowlist exist. Direct remote `set_thinking_level`, `cycle_thinking_level`, `set_model`, `cycle_model`, and `get_available_models` remain blocked. The action is safe because the host computes the target level from the current session model and returns only bounded action state, not the provider's full model/thinking matrix.

Persistence:

- Fast mode is session-local and non-persistent.
- Enabling or disabling it must call thinking-level mutation with default persistence disabled.
- It must not write `defaultThinkingLevel`, `defaultProvider`, `defaultModel`, `enabledModels`, profile settings, or review model settings.
- New session, session switch, profile switch, resource reload, model switch, model cycle, or scoped-model changes clear the fast-mode overlay and recompute descriptor state.

Follow-up 2026-06-23: this v1 boundary is not the final preference model. Future work should define a shared host-owned preference abstraction for native-controllable chat policy:

- Global defaults editable from native General settings, such as Fast mode on/off by default and a default model, subject to host policy.
- Per-chat overrides so multiple conversations can independently opt into Fast mode or a model choice while other chats inherit defaults.
- An explicit effective-value model: preference key, configured global default, optional chat override, effective value, inheritance source, allowed values/actions, reset-to-default behavior, and update events.
- The same abstraction should cover Fast mode and model selection. Model selection still needs a separate remote-safe model policy before exposing global or chat-scoped model choices over Iroh.
- Profiles and scoped models remain authoritative policy inputs. Chat overrides and global defaults must not expose provider secrets, full model catalogs, costs, config paths, or raw profile/scoped-model metadata to iOS.

### Resolved 2026-06-23: Chat-Scoped Defaults and Model Preference Policy

E.5 decision: the long-term model for Fast mode and model selection is a shared host-owned preference descriptor layer, not separate iOS-special cases and not raw settings/model RPC. V1 `thinking.fast_mode` remains the shipped behavior: session-local, non-persistent, thinking-only, and remote-safe. Persisted global defaults and per-chat overrides are deliberately deferred until the preference descriptor layer and remote-safe model policy exist.

Preference abstraction:

- A native-controllable preference has a stable key, global default value, optional chat override, effective value, inheritance source, allowed values/actions, reset-to-default behavior, disabled reason, and update events.
- Global defaults are edited from native General settings through host-owned preference actions. If an active profile is selected, writes must follow the existing profile-aware settings behavior; otherwise they write the normal user default. Project settings remain host-controlled unless a separate project-settings policy allows remote writes.
- Per-chat overrides are stored with the chat/session, not in global or project settings. Switching conversations restores that conversation's overrides; new conversations inherit the current effective defaults.
- A chat whose override is unset always inherits the latest effective global/profile/scoped default. A chat with an explicit override keeps that override until the user resets it, even if another chat or the global default changes.
- Preference updates emit the same kind of host-owned state/action invalidation used by UI actions so iOS refreshes visible cards, chat controls, and General settings without synthesizing slash commands.

Precedence and constraints:

- Host launch flags, project trust, provider auth, profile overlays, project settings, and scoped model constraints remain policy inputs that can constrain or disable native preference changes.
- Scoped models constrain the available model set. A chat or global default model can only select a host-advertised allowed model option; if the stored option becomes unavailable, the host reports an inherited/fallback effective value and a bounded reason.
- Profile switches and resource reloads recompute allowed values and effective values. Existing chat overrides are revalidated rather than blindly applied.
- For continuing or resumed chats, persisted chat/session model state remains authoritative unless the user resets the chat override or host policy invalidates it.

Fast mode preference behavior:

- Future global Fast mode default uses a boolean default such as "start new chats in Fast mode when supported."
- Future per-chat Fast mode uses a boolean override with an inherited state. Multiple conversations can therefore independently have Fast mode on while other conversations inherit the global default.
- Applying effective Fast mode still uses the host-owned lower-thinking policy from `thinking.fast_mode`; unsupported models expose a disabled or ineffective state with a bounded reason rather than leaking provider capability matrices.

Model selection preference behavior:

- Model selection uses the same preference shape as Fast mode, but it is blocked over Iroh until a remote-safe model option policy is designed.
- The model policy must expose only host-approved option ids and display labels needed for a native picker. It must not expose full model catalogs, auth state, costs, raw provider metadata, profile contents, scoped-model patterns, or config paths.
- Setting a chat model override changes only that chat/session's model preference. Setting a global default model changes only future inherited chats, subject to profile/scoped constraints.

iOS-visible metadata:

- iOS may display the preference label, effective value label, inherited versus chat-specific state, reset availability, disabled reason, and host-approved option labels.
- iOS must not display profile contents, project/user config paths, provider secrets, raw `enabledModels` patterns, full model catalogs, costs, or auth internals.

Future unlock conditions:

- Add typed preference descriptors or a settings scope to the UI action layer.
- Add session metadata storage for chat overrides and migration behavior for existing sessions.
- Add host tests for inheritance, per-chat independence, profile/scoped precedence, invalid stored values, and no persistence from v1 `thinking.fast_mode`.
- Add Iroh allowlist and sanitizer tests before exposing any model preference surface remotely.

Policy:

- Enabling captures the current thinking level as the restore level, then applies the lowest-latency supported level that lowers the current model's thinking setting.
- The target order is `off`, then `minimal`, then `low`, filtered by the current model's supported thinking levels.
- If the target would not lower the current level, the descriptor is disabled with a reason such as "Current model is already at its fastest supported thinking level."
- Disabling restores the captured thinking level, clamped to the current model if the model changed before the action state refreshed.
- Manual thinking-level changes, explicit model changes, profile switches, and scoped-model changes turn fast mode off; the user's explicit choice becomes the new session state.

Scoped models and profiles remain authoritative:

- Profile defaults and scoped model `:thinking` suffixes define the base session model/thinking state.
- Fast mode is an overlay on that base state for the current session only.
- Scoped model cycling keeps its existing behavior: an explicit scoped thinking level overrides the previous session level, and an omitted scoped thinking level inherits the current session preference after fast mode has been cleared.
- A future full `model.fast_mode` may switch models only after a separate remote model policy defines how host-owned fast variants are configured and how profile/scoped defaults are restored.

iOS may display only host-provided, bounded metadata:

- Action label, description, presentation, boolean state, state label, disabled reason, and invocation message.
- The current active model provider/id and thinking level already available through `get_state`.
- No model catalog, costs, provider capability matrices, auth state, profile contents, scoped model list, configured defaults, or provider-specific thinking maps.

### User Intent

Fast mode means: prefer speed and lower cost/latency over maximum reasoning depth when the current model/profile supports a meaningful speed tradeoff.

The v1 implementation is deliberately narrower than the long-term product idea:

- Lower the current thinking level to `off`, `minimal`, or `low` when that is supported and actually lowers latency.
- Do nothing with a clear disabled reason if no faster thinking level exists.
- Do not switch models, select a configured fast profile, or change review behavior in v1.

### Action Shape

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "thinking.fast_mode",
  "label": "Fast mode",
  "description": "Use the fastest supported thinking level for this session.",
  "source": "builtin",
  "category": "model",
  "presentation": { "kind": "toggle", "group": "Model" },
  "enabled": true,
  "remoteSafe": true,
  "streamingBehavior": "disabled",
  "state": {
    "type": "boolean",
    "value": false,
    "label": "Normal reasoning"
  },
  "args": [
    {
      "name": "enabled",
      "type": "boolean",
      "required": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Invocation:

```json
{"type":"invoke_ui_action","action":"thinking.fast_mode","args":{"enabled":true}}
```

Response uses generic action state and refresh hints:

```json
{
  "type": "response",
  "command": "invoke_ui_action",
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "action": "thinking.fast_mode",
    "status": "completed",
    "state": { "type": "boolean", "value": true, "label": "Fast: minimal thinking" },
    "stateChanged": true,
    "actionsChanged": true,
    "message": "Fast mode enabled: minimal thinking"
  }
}
```

The app can display returned state and message but should not calculate the target level.

### Deferred Full Model Fast Mode

Full `model.fast_mode` remains deferred until a remote model policy answers:

- How users configure host-owned fast variants without exposing raw model catalogs over Iroh.
- Whether model-speed preferences live in a profile, a named policy, or session state.
- How to restore scoped model/profile defaults after a temporary fast model switch.
- Whether **Deep mode** or review-specific model policy should be separate actions.

## Review Cards Design

Review workflows are a strong fit for native action cards.

### Resolved 2026-06-23: Review Remote-Safety and First Card Set

A.5 decision: v1 exposes only two remotely visible review cards after the shared action registry exists:

- `review.uncommitted`: review uncommitted workspace changes against `HEAD`, including untracked file names as extra context.
- `review.branch`: review `HEAD` against a base branch. The `base` argument is optional; if omitted the host auto-detects `origin/HEAD`, `main`, or `master`.

These actions may be shown over Iroh only after `invoke_ui_action` reauthorization exists. They require confirmation, are disabled while streaming or compacting, and use `streamingBehavior: "disabled"`. They are not file-destructive, but they do consume model tokens, inspect workspace diffs, may read project files during the isolated review session, and create a fresh Volt session seeded with findings.

Deferred or local-only review actions:

- `review.pr`: local-only in v1. It runs `gh pr view` and `gh pr diff`, can contact GitHub, and may use host GitHub credentials or expose private PR metadata. Remote unlock requires a GitHub/network credential policy and confirmation copy that names that external access.
- `review.commit`: local-only in v1. It needs a native recent-commit picker or explicit arbitrary-ref policy before remote exposure, because commit subjects/history are a separate data surface.
- `review.tools`: local-only. Tool selection persists `reviewTools` settings and can reveal extension/custom tool names and provenance; remote review tool policy is fixed by the host.
- `review.staged`: deferred because the current review implementation has no staged-only target.

First remote descriptors:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "review.uncommitted",
  "label": "Review changes",
  "description": "Review uncommitted workspace changes.",
  "source": "builtin",
  "category": "review",
  "presentation": { "kind": "card", "group": "Review", "priority": 100 },
  "enabled": true,
  "remoteSafe": true,
  "requiresConfirmation": true,
  "destructive": false,
  "streamingBehavior": "disabled",
  "slash": { "name": "review", "example": "/review uncommitted" }
}
```

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "review.branch",
  "label": "Review branch",
  "description": "Review the current branch against its merge base.",
  "source": "builtin",
  "category": "review",
  "presentation": { "kind": "card", "group": "Review", "priority": 90 },
  "enabled": true,
  "remoteSafe": true,
  "requiresConfirmation": true,
  "destructive": false,
  "streamingBehavior": "disabled",
  "slash": { "name": "review", "example": "/review branch [base]" },
  "args": [
    {
      "name": "base",
      "label": "Base branch",
      "type": "string",
      "required": false,
      "placeholder": "main"
    }
  ]
}
```

Local-only/deferred descriptors can exist in local RPC/TUI action discovery, but must be filtered from Iroh until their policy is resolved:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "review.pr",
  "label": "Review PR",
  "description": "Review a GitHub pull request.",
  "source": "builtin",
  "category": "review",
  "presentation": { "kind": "card", "group": "Review", "priority": 80 },
  "enabled": false,
  "disabledReason": "GitHub credential and network policy is not remote-safe yet.",
  "remoteSafe": false,
  "requiresConfirmation": true,
  "slash": { "name": "review", "example": "/review pr [number]" },
  "args": [
    {
      "name": "target",
      "label": "PR number, URL, or branch",
      "type": "string",
      "required": false,
      "placeholder": "123"
    }
  ]
}
```

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "review.commit",
  "label": "Review commit",
  "description": "Review one commit by ref.",
  "source": "builtin",
  "category": "review",
  "presentation": { "kind": "palette", "group": "Review", "priority": 70 },
  "enabled": false,
  "disabledReason": "Commit picker and arbitrary-ref policy are not remote-safe yet.",
  "remoteSafe": false,
  "requiresConfirmation": true,
  "slash": { "name": "review", "example": "/review commit <sha>" },
  "args": [
    {
      "name": "sha",
      "label": "Commit ref",
      "type": "string",
      "required": true,
      "placeholder": "HEAD"
    }
  ]
}
```

Host-side review execution remains authoritative for:

- Fixed git command execution for remote-safe targets:
  - `review.uncommitted`: `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`, `git diff HEAD` or no-commit fallback `git diff --cached` plus `git diff`, and `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`.
  - `review.branch`: the same repository check, optional base detection with `git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` and `git rev-parse --verify --quiet main/master`, explicit base validation with `git rev-parse --verify --quiet <base>`, `git diff <base>...HEAD`, and `git log --oneline <base>..HEAD`.
- Review prompt construction and diff truncation. Descriptors and invocation responses must not include the raw diff.
- Model choice. If `reviewModel` is configured and authenticated, the host may use it; otherwise the current session model is used. iOS must not see configured review model values, model catalogs, auth state, or provider policy.
- Review tool policy. Local TUI review may keep using configured `reviewTools`; remote v1 review must use a host-owned read-only tool set and must not expose tool names or extension source labels. The remote v1 reviewer tool set is limited to safe read/navigation tools such as `read`, `grep`, `find`, and `ls`. It must not include `edit`, `write`, arbitrary extension tools, or `bash` unless a future explicit unsafe-review-tools policy is added.
- Session replacement. Successful review starts a fresh session seeded only with numbered findings, matching current `/review` behavior. If session replacement is blocked, findings may be added to the current session using the existing host logic.
- Security checks and project trust. Review actions use the registered workspace cwd only, never a client-provided host path. The host rechecks project trust, current streaming/compaction state, model availability, target validity, remote allowlist, and action enabled state at invocation time.

Confirmation text should tell the user that review will inspect the selected diff, may read related project files with host-approved read-only tools, consumes model tokens, and will create a fresh session with findings. For `review.branch`, the confirmation should include the resolved base branch before the run starts when available.

The iOS app should only provide user intent and optional arguments.

## Relationship to Existing RPC Commands

Several built-in actions already have RPC equivalents. The action layer can initially delegate to those instead of duplicating logic.

| User-facing action | Existing RPC equivalent | Long-term action id |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New conversation | `new_session` | `session.new` |
| Load transcript | `get_transcript` | not normally a user action |
| List sessions | `list_sessions` | `session.list` or native screen data source |
| Resume session | `switch_session_by_id` | `session.switch` |
| Cancel active run | `abort` | `run.cancel` |
| Compact context | `compact` in local RPC, currently not remote allowlisted | `context.compact` |
| Set session name | `set_session_name` in local RPC | `session.rename` |
| Set model | `set_model` in local RPC | `model.set` |
| Get models | `get_available_models` in local RPC | data source for `model.set` |
| Fast thinking toggle | `set_thinking_level` in local RPC | `thinking.fast_mode` |
| Extension command | `prompt` with `/cmd` | `extension.command.*` |
| Skill | `prompt` with `/skill:name` | `skill.*` |
| Prompt template | `prompt` with `/template` | `prompt.template.*` |

For Iroh remote, every action must be separately reviewed before being exposed. Existing local RPC availability does not automatically imply remote availability.

## Remote Security Model

The remote action layer must be allowlist-based.

Each action should declare or derive:

- `remoteSafe`: can be exposed to remote clients.
- `requiresConfirmation`: app should ask or host will ask before execution.
- `destructive`: action can mutate local state or files.
- `requiresTrust`: action requires project trust.
- `requiredCapabilities`: feature flags or protocol versions.
- `allowedDuringStreaming`: whether action can run while the agent is active.

Host policy remains authoritative even if the app shows stale enabled state. `invoke_ui_action` must re-check permissions and current state before execution.

Remote descriptors must not expose:

- Host-local file paths.
- Extension source file paths.
- Prompt template bodies.
- Skill full content or base directories.
- Raw package install paths.
- Provider secrets, auth state internals, or environment variables.
- Full session/transcript payloads.

Descriptors may expose bounded/sanitized:

- Command name.
- Description.
- Source kind.
- Source scope such as `user`, `project`, or `package`.
- Package/display label if safe.
- Argument hints.
- Enabled state and disabled reason.

## Extension Model

There are two levels of extension support.

### Phase 1: Project Existing Extension Commands

Existing `volt.registerCommand()` commands appear as palette actions. They can be invoked remotely by action id, but the host internally calls the registered command handler.

Behavior:

- Remote descriptor uses command `invocationName`, description, and argument completion if safe.
- Invocation passes a single `arguments` string, matching existing command handler semantics.
- Extension UI requests continue through the existing `extension_ui_request` protocol.
- Commands that rely on TUI-only APIs may receive degraded RPC UI behavior just as they do today.

### Resolved 2026-06-23: First-Class Extension Actions Deferred for V1

E.3 decision: do not add `volt.registerAction()` in the v1 native action pass. Existing extension commands remain the compatibility surface and continue to project as remote-safe palette actions with the descriptor `arguments` field, command-argument completions, opaque session-local ids, and invocation through the host `AgentSession.prompt()` path.

Rationale:

- A first-class native action API needs stable extension-owned id rules, package/project identity, collision handling, reload migration behavior, project trust enforcement, descriptor validation, remote-safety review, and handler lifecycle semantics.
- The current command projection already covers the safe compatibility requirement for mobile palette invocation without exposing extension source paths or requiring clients to synthesize slash text.
- Adding card/toggle-capable extension handlers before those policy rules exist would create a wider remote execution and UI surface than the v1 action contract has reviewed.

Compatibility behavior that must remain covered:

- `volt.registerCommand()` commands appear as `source: "extension"` palette actions, not primary cards.
- Descriptor ids use the `extension.command.*` opaque dynamic prefix and must be refreshed after catalog changes.
- The descriptor contains a single optional string argument named `arguments`; when the command supplies argument completions, the descriptor advertises `completion: "commandArguments"`.
- Invocation by action id passes the raw `arguments` string to the existing command path and may return terminal `handled` without requiring an agent turn.
- Project-local command projection remains gated by the existing project-trust resource loading path, and remote invocation still rechecks the live descriptor and remote-safe policy.

### Future: Extension-Provided Native Actions

Add a richer extension API so extensions can declare native actions directly:

```ts
volt.registerAction({
  id: "my-extension.deploy",
  label: "Deploy",
  description: "Deploy current branch",
  presentation: { kind: "card", group: "Deploy" },
  args: [
    { name: "environment", type: "string", required: true, options: ["dev", "staging", "prod"] },
  ],
  remoteSafe: true,
  async handler(args, ctx) {
    // ...
  },
});
```

This avoids overloading slash command strings and gives extensions first-class native UI metadata.

Extension-provided actions must pass the same trust and remote-safety filters as extension commands.

## UI Request Protocol Evolution

The current extension UI protocol already supports:

- `select`
- `confirm`
- `input`
- `editor`
- `notify`
- `setStatus`
- `setWidget`
- `setTitle`
- `set_editor_text`

Long term, built-in actions should use the same request/response mechanism when they need user input. For example, `session.new` could request confirmation; `model.set` could request a picker; `review.pr` could request a text input.

Potential additions:

- `form`: structured multi-field input.
- `progress`: bounded progress status separate from transcript.
- `openPanel`: request that the app opens a specific native panel.
- `actionResult`: rich result notification for action cards.

The first implementation should avoid complex custom layouts. iOS can build native screens from action descriptors and simple UI requests.

## iOS UX Model

### Action Center Page

A dedicated page can show curated groups:

- **Review**: Review changes, Review branch, Review PR.
- **Model**: Fast mode, Thinking level, Model picker.
- **Session**: New conversation, Resume session, Rename session.
- **Context**: Compact context, Load older transcript.
- **Extensions**: Extension commands and extension-provided cards.
- **Skills**: Skill invocations.

The app should distinguish:

- Host-curated primary actions.
- User/project extension actions.
- Advanced palette items.
- Disabled actions with explanation.

### Prompt Editor Integration

The prompt editor can support slash autocomplete by querying action descriptors:

- `/` opens a native command palette.
- Selecting an action either inserts text, opens an argument form, or invokes directly.
- For text-producing prompt templates and skills, the app can show a form and then invoke by id.
- For advanced compatibility, raw text submission remains supported.

### Card Invocation Flow

1. User taps card.
2. If required arguments are missing, app opens a native form.
3. If `requiresConfirmation` is true, app confirms or lets host send a confirmation UI request.
4. App sends `invoke_ui_action`.
5. App shows optimistic pending state for that action.
6. Host response returns `accepted`, `queued`, `completed`, `handled`, or `cancelled`, or a normal RPC error.
7. `completed`, `handled`, `cancelled`, and errors clear pending state immediately.
8. `accepted` waits for normal agent events through `agent_end`; `queued` clears tap pending state but leaves queue/streaming UI driven by `queue_update` and later agent events.

### Stale Data Handling

Action descriptors can become stale when:

- Session switches.
- Extensions reload.
- Project trust changes.
- Model changes.
- Agent starts/stops streaming.
- Remote workspace changes.

The app should refresh actions after:

- Initial connect/reconnect.
- `get_state` showing a new `sessionId`.
- `ui_actions_changed` event.
- Successful `new_session` or `switch_session_by_id`.
- Extension reload completion.

## Protocol Versioning

Add explicit capabilities so clients can adapt safely.

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "response",
  "command": "get_ui_capabilities",
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "protocolVersion": 1,
    "features": [
      "ui_actions.v1",
      "ui_action_invocation.v1",
      "ui_action_completions.v1"
    ],
    "maxActions": 200,
    "maxDescriptorBytes": 65536
  }
}
```

Compatibility rules:

- Clients ignore unknown descriptor fields.
- Hosts reject unknown action ids at invocation time.
- Hosts may omit actions that are unavailable or unsafe for the client.
- Clients should handle missing features by falling back to current prompt/new-session/session-list behavior.

## Resolved 2026-06-23: Core RPC UI Action Protocol Foundation

B.1 implementation adds the v1 native UI action protocol shape to the local RPC contract without widening Iroh remote access.

Concrete behavior:

- `RpcCommand` includes `get_ui_capabilities`, `get_ui_actions`, and `invoke_ui_action`.
- `RpcResponse` includes success shapes for UI action capabilities, action lists, and invocation responses.
- Exported protocol types include `UiActionDescriptor`, presentation hints, argument/state descriptors, capabilities, action-list responses, and invocation responses.
- `RpcClientBase` exposes typed `getUiCapabilities()`, `getUiActions(scope?)`, and `invokeUiAction(action, options?)` helpers.
- Local `runRpcMode` returns protocol v1 capabilities with only `ui_actions.v1` advertised, returns an empty `actions` array for `get_ui_actions`, and rejects `invoke_ui_action` with a normal RPC error until handlers exist.
- `docs/rpc.md` documents the non-remote commands, descriptor shape, invocation response statuses, and security notes.
- At the B.1 foundation step, Iroh remote RPC remained allowlist-based and did not yet forward UI action commands; B.3 and B.5 own remote allowlist changes.

## Resolved 2026-06-23: Dynamic Host Action Discovery

B.2 implementation projects existing dynamic command sources into sanitized local RPC UI action descriptors.

Concrete behavior:

- `get_ui_actions` returns palette descriptors for extension commands, prompt templates, and skills for the default, `palette`, and `all` scopes. `primary` remains empty until host-curated built-in action cards exist.
- Projected extension command ids use session-local opaque ids under `extension.command.*`; prompt templates use `prompt.template.*`; skills use `skill.*`.
- Duplicate extension command invocation names are preserved in descriptor labels and slash aliases, matching the existing `getRegisteredCommands()` resolution.
- Descriptors include bounded labels, descriptions, hints, safe source scope/origin fields, and generic source labels such as `Project`, `User`, `Temporary`, or `Package`.
- Descriptors omit raw `sourceInfo`, extension source paths, prompt template file paths and bodies, skill file paths, skill base directories, and package install paths.
- Display text projection redacts path-like strings before bounding so accidental path mentions in descriptions or hints do not leak through the action list.
- Dynamic descriptors are marked `remoteSafe: true` as an action-level classification, but Iroh remote access remains blocked until B.3 adds the explicit allowlist and outbound descriptor policy.
- `invoke_ui_action` remains unavailable until B.4 implements prompt-like action invocation and stale-id checks.

## Resolved 2026-06-23: Iroh Safe Action Discovery

B.3 implementation allows read-only native action discovery over Iroh without widening unrelated remote RPC access.

Concrete behavior:

- The Iroh remote RPC command allowlist now forwards `get_ui_capabilities` and `get_ui_actions`.
- `invoke_ui_action` remains blocked over Iroh until B.5 adds invocation-time reauthorization and action-level remote-safety checks.
- Raw legacy/local RPC commands remain blocked over Iroh, including `get_messages`, `get_commands`, path-based `switch_session`, unrestricted model listing/selection, local tool RPC such as `bash`, and host file export RPC.
- Remote action descriptor responses pass through the existing Iroh outbound sanitizer after descriptor-level sanitization. Workspace paths in descriptor-like string or path fields normalize to the remote workspace path, while dedicated redaction/omission rules still apply to known sensitive path fields.
- `docs/rpc.md` and `docs/iroh-remote-protocol.md` document the remote discovery surface and the continued invocation/legacy-command boundary.

## Resolved 2026-06-23: Prompt-Like Local Action Invocation

B.4 implementation adds local `invoke_ui_action` support for the dynamic actions discovered in B.2 while keeping Iroh remote invocation disabled until B.5.

Concrete behavior:

- Local RPC capabilities now advertise `ui_action_invocation.v1`; Iroh remote RPC passes `allowUiActionInvocation: false`, so remote capabilities continue to advertise discovery only.
- `invoke_ui_action` resolves the current dynamic action catalog and invokes extension command, prompt template, and skill actions by descriptor id.
- Invocation supports one optional raw string argument named `arguments`. Unknown argument names or non-string `arguments` values are rejected with normal RPC errors.
- Extension command actions invoke their slash alias through `AgentSession.prompt()` and return `handled` after prompt preflight succeeds, so synchronous command handlers do not require `agent_end`.
- Prompt template and skill actions invoke through the same host prompt path used by raw slash compatibility. Idle invocations return `accepted`; streaming invocations require `streamingBehavior: "steer"` or `"followUp"` and return `queued` with `queuedAs`.
- Dynamic ids now include an opaque per-session catalog token. The token changes when the current extension/prompt/skill catalog changes or when a new session object owns the catalog, so stale ids reject instead of silently invoking a different action at the same index.

## Resolved 2026-06-23: Iroh Prompt-Like Action Invocation

B.5 implementation exposes the B.4 prompt-like action invocation path over Iroh for the currently reviewed remote-safe dynamic action classes only.

Concrete behavior:

- The Iroh remote command filter accepts `invoke_ui_action` only for projected dynamic ids under `extension.command.*`, `prompt.template.*`, and `skill.*`. Local-only built-in ids, deferred review/model ids, malformed ids, and unreviewed prefixes receive a normal RPC error before reaching the local Volt RPC process.
- Integrated Iroh RPC runs with `allowUiActionInvocation: true` and a remote-safe action policy. Remote descriptor lists are filtered to `remoteSafe: true`, and invocation rechecks the live descriptor's `remoteSafe` flag before dispatch.
- Spawned-child Iroh hosts no longer strip `ui_action_invocation.v1` from `get_ui_capabilities`; their outbound `get_ui_actions` responses are filtered to `remoteSafe: true` before path sanitization.
- Remote invocation still uses the host `AgentSession.prompt()` expansion path from B.4, so extension commands return terminal `handled`, prompt templates and skills return `accepted` while idle, and queued prompt-like actions return `queued`.
- Iroh close/defer tracking treats terminal `invoke_ui_action` statuses such as `handled`, `completed`, and `cancelled` as complete after the response write, while `accepted` and `queued` continue to wait for the normal prompt lifecycle where the transport path requires that wait.

## Resolved 2026-06-23: iOS RPC Action Models

C.1 implementation adds the typed iOS client protocol surface needed before session loading and UI work.

Concrete behavior:

- `VoltRPCCommand` now encodes `get_ui_capabilities`, `get_ui_actions` with optional `scope`, and `invoke_ui_action` with action id, optional argument object, and optional queue behavior.
- `VoltClient` exposes Swift models for capabilities, action list responses, descriptors, presentation hints, argument metadata, option metadata, action state, streaming behavior, slash aliases, and invocation responses.
- Descriptor parsing keeps required v1 fields strict, passes unknown source/category/presentation/argument/state/streaming string values through for forward compatibility, ignores unknown fields, and skips invalid descriptors, argument entries, or option entries without failing the whole action list.
- Tests cover command JSONL encoding and descriptor parsing with unknown fields, invalid entries, presentation/source metadata, enabled and disabled reason state, argument metadata, state snapshots, streaming behavior, and slash aliases.

## Resolved 2026-06-23: iOS Session Action Discovery

C.2 implementation loads host native action descriptors into `VoltSession` as optional capability-driven state.

Concrete behavior:

- `VoltSession` now stores `uiActionCapabilities`, `uiActions`, `isLoadingUIActions`, `uiActionLoadError`, and `uiActionsUnsupported`.
- Connect and reconnect request state, transcript, and UI action capabilities without changing transcript loading semantics. When `ui_actions.v1` is advertised, the session requests `get_ui_actions` with `scope: "all"` and stores parsed descriptors.
- New conversation, session switch, changed `sessionId` in `get_state`, `ui_actions_changed`, and `ui_action_state_changed` clear stale descriptors and refresh the action list.
- Capability/list failures do not fail the connection. Unsupported capability responses are treated as a non-fatal fallback; malformed or failed action-list responses are stored in action error state instead of transcript noise.
- The demo mock transport advertises the v1 action protocol and returns a safe mock palette action so local demo sessions exercise the discovery path.
- Lifecycle tests cover initial connect/reconnect request ordering, successful capability/list loading, invalid descriptor skipping, unsupported-command fallback, session-change refresh, action-change refresh, and unchanged transcript loading behavior.

## Resolved 2026-06-23: iOS Command Palette

C.3 implementation exposes discovered descriptors through a native SwiftUI command palette while leaving response lifecycle handling to C.4.

Concrete behavior:

- The chat composer plus button opens a native command palette sheet backed by `VoltSession.uiActions`.
- The palette is searchable and groups visible actions by category and source. Rows show action label, host description, source/category/slash badges, and source-specific icon/accent treatment so extension, prompt, skill, package, and built-in actions are visually distinct.
- Loading, unsupported-host, action-list error, empty-list, and no-search-match states render native empty/loading views without affecting the transcript.
- Rows are disabled when disconnected, host-disabled, or requiring argument fields the palette does not support. Host-provided `disabledReason` text is shown for host-disabled actions and disabled rows do not invoke.
- Actions with no arguments, or with only optional arguments outside the single-string case, invoke directly without sending args. Actions whose only argument is a string prompt for text in a second native sheet and send the descriptor argument name as a string value.
- `VoltSession.invokeUIAction` checks connected/enabled state before sending `invoke_ui_action`, omits empty argument objects, and appends a system message only if transport send fails. C.4 remains responsible for handling invocation responses and streaming-state transitions.
- Tests cover session invocation encoding/disabled-action refusal and source-level UI affordances for the command palette, argument sheet, search, grouping/source display, disabled reasons, invocation modes, and invocation calls.

## Resolved 2026-06-23: iOS Action Invocation Lifecycle

C.4 implementation teaches `VoltSession` to track native action invocation pending state and interpret the host disposition response without assuming every action produces an `agent_end`.

Concrete behavior:

- `VoltSession` exposes `pendingUIActionID`/`isInvokingUIAction` and blocks overlapping prompts, session switches, session list loads, older transcript page loads, workspace switches, and new-session requests while an action invocation is awaiting its disposition.
- `invokeUIAction` records pending state before sending `invoke_ui_action`, clears it on send failure, and chooses `streamingBehavior: "followUp"` or `"steer"` from descriptor `queueFollowUp`/`queueSteer` support when invoked during an active stream.
- Successful `invoke_ui_action` responses handle all v1 statuses: `accepted` enters or keeps streaming and remains pending until `agent_end`; `queued` clears tap pending state while preserving the active stream; `completed`, `handled`, and `cancelled` clear pending state immediately without waiting for `agent_end`.
- Failed `invoke_ui_action` responses append an `Action failed` system message and clear action pending state without forcing `isStreaming` false, so an unrelated active turn can continue.
- Invocation responses honor `actionsChanged`, `stateChanged`, and returned action state hints by refreshing actions or state as appropriate.
- The demo mock transport now returns `handled` for its advertised mock command, so demo command invocation exercises the terminal synchronous path.
- Lifecycle tests cover direct invocation encoding, terminal handled/completed/cancelled statuses, prompt-like accepted streaming through `agent_end`, queued follow-up behavior while already streaming, and failure responses preserving the active stream.

## Resolved 2026-06-23: Shared Built-In Action Registry

D.1 and D.2 implementation introduce a shared host action registry for simple built-in actions and route selected TUI/RPC entry points through shared handlers.

Concrete behavior:

- `HostActionRegistry` owns built-in descriptor projection, availability checks, argument metadata and validation, slash alias lookup, remote-safety classification, and handler dispatch.
- Registered simple built-ins are:
  - `session.new`, slash alias `/clear`, remote-safe over Iroh, delegates to the same new-session runtime operation used by `new_session`.
  - `run.cancel`, no slash alias, remote-safe over Iroh, delegates to the same abort operation used by `abort`.
  - `context.compact`, slash alias `/compact`, local-only over Iroh, delegates to the same compaction operation used by local `compact` and accepts optional `customInstructions`.
  - `session.rename`, slash alias `/name <name>`, local-only over Iroh, delegates to the same session naming operation used by local `set_session_name`.
- TUI `/clear`, `/compact`, and `/name` resolve through the shared registry while preserving existing user-visible terminal behavior such as `/name` with no argument showing the current name or usage.
- RPC direct commands `new_session`, `abort`, `compact`, and `set_session_name` use the same core helper functions as built-in `invoke_ui_action` handlers, while preserving their existing response shapes.
- Iroh remote `invoke_ui_action` is still allowlist-based. It forwards exact built-in ids `session.new` and `run.cancel`, plus the previously reviewed projected dynamic prefixes. It rejects `context.compact`, `session.rename`, review/model ids, malformed ids, and unreviewed prefixes before forwarding.
- `get_ui_actions` returns built-in descriptors alongside dynamic palette actions; remote descriptor lists include only actions whose live descriptors are marked `remoteSafe`.

## Resolved 2026-06-23: Review Actions in Shared Registry

D.3 implementation moves the A.5 remote-safe review subset into the shared built-in action registry.

Concrete behavior:

- Registered review built-ins are:
  - `review.uncommitted`, slash presentation `/review uncommitted`, remote-safe over Iroh, card presentation in the Review group, no arguments.
  - `review.branch`, slash presentation `/review branch [base]`, remote-safe over Iroh, card presentation in the Review group, optional string `base` argument.
- Both descriptors require confirmation, are non-destructive, use `streamingBehavior: "disabled"`, and are disabled while the current session is streaming or compacting.
- `get_ui_actions("primary")` now returns curated built-in card/toggle actions, so review cards are visible to native primary action surfaces without projecting dynamic extension/prompt/skill palette entries into primary.
- TUI `/review uncommitted` and `/review branch [base]` route through the registered action handlers after the existing parser resolves user intent. `/review tools`, `/review pr`, `/review commit`, selectors, and pickers remain local-only TUI flows.
- The shared review workflow owns git target resolution, review-model fallback, isolated review execution, and fresh-session seeding. It rechecks streaming/compaction state before the run and uses the registered workspace cwd, never a client-provided host path.
- Remote review invocation requires project trust and host confirmation. RPC/iOS confirmation is emitted through the existing extension UI `confirm` request. Remote review runs with the host-owned read-only review tool set `read`, `grep`, `find`, and `ls`; local TUI review keeps using configured review tools.
- Invocation responses are terminal `completed` or `cancelled` statuses for the review workflow. They may include bounded status text and refresh hints, but they do not include raw diffs, review prompts, configured review model values, auth state, tool names/provenance, or GitHub metadata.
- Iroh `invoke_ui_action` now forwards exact built-in ids `review.uncommitted` and `review.branch` in addition to `session.new`, `run.cancel`, and projected dynamic ids. It continues to reject `review.pr`, `review.commit`, `review.tools`, `context.compact`, `session.rename`, model actions, malformed ids, stale ids, and unreviewed prefixes.
- Automated evidence covers descriptor shape and handler options in `test/host-actions.test.ts`, parser coverage in the existing review suite, local RPC review invocation reaching git target validation in `test/rpc-transport-client.test.ts`, and Iroh allowlist coverage in `test/remote-iroh-core.test.ts`.

## Resolved 2026-06-23: Fast Thinking Action in Shared Registry

D.4 implementation adds the A.4 first model-speed action as `thinking.fast_mode`.

Concrete behavior:

- `thinking.fast_mode` is a shared built-in action with toggle presentation in the Model group, a required boolean `enabled` argument, boolean descriptor state, `streamingBehavior: "disabled"`, and `remoteSafe: true`.
- The action is session-local and non-persistent. Enabling captures the current thinking level as a restore marker, then applies the fastest supported lower thinking level in priority order `off`, `minimal`, `low`.
- If the current model has no lower supported Fast mode target, the descriptor is disabled with a host-owned reason. Non-reasoning models and models whose lower thinking levels are explicitly unsupported therefore do not expose a runnable toggle.
- Disabling restores the captured thinking level through the normal host clamp path. It does not persist defaults and does not switch models.
- Manual thinking-level changes, model changes, scoped-model changes, profile-driven thinking resets, and registry refresh fallback paths clear the session-local Fast mode restore marker so the explicit host/user choice becomes current session state.
- Descriptors and invocation responses expose only bounded toggle metadata, current boolean state, disabled reason, and status text. They never expose model catalogs, provider matrices, cost data, auth state, profile names, scoped model lists, or raw model/provider metadata.
- Iroh `invoke_ui_action` now forwards the exact `thinking.fast_mode` id in addition to the reviewed session and review ids plus projected dynamic ids. Direct remote `get_available_models`, `set_model`, `set_thinking_level`, and `cycle_thinking_level` remain blocked.
- Automated evidence covers descriptor shape, supported/unsupported thinking targets, remote-safe invocation, state refresh after `get_state`/`get_ui_actions`, manual direct thinking changes clearing Fast mode state, and Iroh allowlist/blocklist coverage.

## Resolved 2026-06-23: Descriptor Argument Forms and Completions

E.1 implementation makes the descriptor argument schema actionable instead of treating all palette arguments as one raw string.

Concrete behavior:

- Host invocation validates the v1 argument subset before dispatch: string and multiline string values must be JSON strings, booleans must be JSON booleans, enum values must match descriptor `options`, and integers must be JSON integer numbers.
- Unknown argument names, unsupported argument types, missing required values, and mismatched value types fail with normal RPC errors. Built-in action handlers still own domain validation such as empty session names or review target resolution.
- `get_ui_action_completions` is a v1 RPC command advertised by `ui_action_completions.v1`. It resolves the current action catalog by id, rechecks remote safety for Iroh transports, and returns bounded option descriptors for extension command arguments that advertise `completion: "commandArguments"`.
- Iroh remote filtering allows `get_ui_action_completions` only for the same reviewed action-id set as `invoke_ui_action`: exact remote-safe built-ins and projected dynamic prefixes. Local-only ids and unreviewed prefixes are rejected before forwarding.
- iOS command palette rows open a native argument form when every descriptor argument is supported. The form renders text fields for string and integer values, multiline text fields for multiline strings, toggles for booleans, and menu pickers for enums; unsupported argument types keep the row disabled.
- iOS form state initializes from descriptor defaults where usable, validates required and integer fields before enabling Run, and sends typed JSON values through `invoke_ui_action`.

## Resolved 2026-06-23: iOS Actions Page

E.2 implementation adds a dedicated native iOS Actions tab that renders host-curated primary action descriptors instead of hardcoded slash commands.

Concrete behavior:

- `ActionsView` filters descriptors with primary presentation kinds (`card`, `button`, and `toggle`) and groups them by host-provided presentation group, with stable ordering for Review, Model, Session, Context, Extensions, Skills, and Advanced.
- Review cards and the `thinking.fast_mode` Model toggle appear when the connected host exposes them. The page also renders disabled cards with the host-provided disabled reason, such as an unavailable Review branch card.
- Card and button invocations call `VoltSession.invokeUIAction`; toggle invocations send a typed boolean `enabled` argument through the same RPC path and optimistically display state until the host response/action refresh arrives.
- The app shell now handles host `confirm` extension UI requests with a native alert and replies using `extension_ui_response.confirmed`, so remote Review actions can ask for confirmation without being auto-cancelled.
- The demo transport exposes primary Review and Fast mode descriptors for simulator smoke coverage. Demo Review starts a mock accepted agent run; Demo Fast mode completes synchronously and refreshes action state.
- Manual simulator smoke on iPhone 17 Pro iOS 27.0 used Demo transport, opened the Actions tab, verified Review and Model groups, verified disabled Review branch reason, toggled Fast mode to `Fast: low`, invoked Review changes, and verified the Chat transcript received `Mock review started. No issues found.` Screenshots were saved at `/tmp/volt-actions-smoke-actions.png` and `/tmp/volt-actions-smoke-chat.png`.

## Resolved 2026-06-23: iOS Extension Action Groups

E.4 implementation renders projected extension commands in the native Actions tab after the E.3 `registerAction()` defer decision.

Concrete behavior:

- ActionsView includes host primary `card`/`button`/`toggle` descriptors and projected extension command descriptors whose source/category are `extension` and whose presentation kind is `palette`.
- Projected extension commands appear in the host-provided Extensions group with the same disabled-state and pending-state handling as other action rows.
- Extension rows show safe metadata badges for source type, sanitized source label or scope, and slash alias, so users can distinguish extension/package actions such as `Extension`, `Package`, `Demo`, `/disabled`, and `/mock` without exposing source paths.
- ActionsView invokes enabled projected extension commands through the existing `VoltSession.invokeUIAction` path. Commands with required unsupported arguments stay disabled on the Actions page; richer argument entry remains available through the command palette.
- The demo transport now returns one enabled projected extension command and one disabled package-origin extension command, and handles the enabled mock command with a terminal `handled` response.
- Manual simulator smoke on iPhone 17 Pro iOS 27.0 used Demo transport, opened the Actions tab, verified the Extensions group, disabled package-labeled command, enabled Demo command, and tapped the mock command without leaving a stuck pending state. Screenshots were saved at `/tmp/volt-e4-actions-extension.png` and `/tmp/volt-e4-actions-after-mock.png`.

## Resolved 2026-06-23: Native Action Documentation Refresh

F.1 documentation refresh records the user-facing and protocol contract for the completed native action surfaces.

Concrete behavior documented:

- `packages/coding-agent/docs/rpc.md` describes native action discovery, primary versus palette scopes, descriptor safety, slash aliases as presentation, built-in action ids, dynamic extension/prompt/skill projection, invocation statuses, and deferred/local-only surfaces.
- `packages/coding-agent/docs/iroh-remote-protocol.md` describes the remote allowlist, sanitized descriptor metadata, extension UI behavior over RPC, exact forwarded action ids/prefixes, and deferred remote model/settings/package/profile surfaces.
- `packages/coding-agent/docs/extensions.md` documents projected extension commands as palette actions, source-label safety, project-trust gating, existing extension UI request handling, and the v1 `registerAction()` defer.
- `packages/coding-agent/docs/prompt-templates.md` and `packages/coding-agent/docs/skills.md` document their native palette projections, opaque action ids, host-owned expansion paths, and omitted bodies/paths.
- `../volt-app/README.md` documents the iOS command palette, Actions tab, supported Review/Fast/extension action presentation, invocation lifecycle, sanitized metadata boundary, and deferred native action surfaces.

## Resolved 2026-06-23: Final Cross-Surface Validation

F.2 final validation covered the host registry/RPC/Iroh path, iOS client models/session behavior, simulator UI, documentation hygiene, and deferred-scope boundaries.

Automated evidence:

- Targeted host tests passed with `node node_modules/vitest/dist/cli.js --run test/host-actions.test.ts test/rpc-transport-client.test.ts test/remote-iroh-core.test.ts test/suite/review.test.ts test/suite/agent-session-model-extension.test.ts` from `packages/coding-agent`: 5 files, 143 tests.
- Iroh scenario coverage passed with `npm run iroh:poc:test`, including reconnect/session, pairing/revocation, multi-workspace, authorization, ticket, and persisted-tool scenarios.
- Monorepo check passed with `npm run check`.
- Swift package validation passed with `swift test` from `../volt-app/Packages/VoltClient`: 23 XCTest tests plus 103 Swift Testing tests.
- iOS simulator validation passed with XcodeBuildMCP `test_sim` on `iPhone 17 Pro` and `xcodebuild -scheme Volt -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro,OS=27.0' test` from `../volt-app`: 109 simulator tests.

Manual iOS smoke evidence:

- Environment: iPhone 17 Pro simulator on iOS 27.0, macOS 27.0 build 26A5353q, app commit `1c66868fd1b9`, Volt host commit `1ca030096e06`.
- Transport: Demo transport connected as `mock / local-demo`; real Iroh host behavior was covered by the Iroh scenario suite rather than a live manual pairing in this smoke.
- Connected to Demo from Settings and verified no pairing ticket or secret was visible. Saved-host metadata was bounded to a short host id, workspace name, and relay mode.
- Loaded the native Actions tab and verified Review, Model, and Extensions groups, including disabled reasons and safe extension badges only (`Extension`, `Package`, `Demo`, `/disabled`, `/mock`).
- Invoked the prompt-like `Review changes` action and verified Chat transcript output `Mock review started. No issues found.` Screenshot: `/tmp/volt-f2-review-output.png`.
- Invoked the synchronous `Fast mode` toggle and verified state refreshed from `Normal reasoning` to `Fast: low` while the model label stayed `mock / local-demo`. Screenshot: `/tmp/volt-f2-fast-mode.png`.
- Started a new conversation and then switched to `Previous mock chat`; after the session switch, the Actions list refreshed and still showed the expected Review, Fast mode, and extension descriptors. Screenshots: `/tmp/volt-f2-new-conversation.png`, `/tmp/volt-f2-session-switch.png`, `/tmp/volt-f2-actions-after-switch.png`.
- No manual screenshot exposed raw source paths, prompt or skill bodies, full pairing tickets, reconnect secrets, raw model catalogs, git diffs, or tool metadata.

Unsupported or deferred surfaces are not counted as implemented: first-class `volt.registerAction()` cards, real-device smoke, live manual Iroh pairing, remote model selection, global/default Fast mode settings, per-chat model overrides, package/profile settings, and richer action-specific result payloads remain future work or separately documented decisions.

## Resolved 2026-06-23: Rollup for iOS Preview Use

F.3 rollup status: native remote UI actions are ready for iOS preview use within the v1 scope.

The completed v1 scope includes host-owned action discovery, descriptor sanitization, shared built-in action registry, prompt-like and synchronous invocation semantics, Iroh allowlist/sanitizer coverage, iOS command palette, native Actions tab, descriptor-driven forms/toggles, projected extension command groups, documentation, changelog coverage, and final validation evidence.

Explicit limitations remain intentional future work rather than open implementation decisions:

- `volt.registerAction()` is deferred; projected extension commands keep the compatibility path.
- `thinking.fast_mode` is session-local and non-persistent in v1. The future shared preference descriptor abstraction covers global defaults, native General settings, per-chat overrides, inherited effective values, reset-to-default behavior, and model selection policy.
- Direct remote model listing/selection stays blocked until a remote-safe model option policy, session preference storage, and sanitizer/allowlist tests exist.
- Raw slash prompt compatibility remains supported for extension commands, skills, and prompt templates while native descriptors are used opportunistically.

## Resolved 2026-07-02: Direct Remote Model/Thinking RPC Unblocked

Owner decision 2026-07-02: per-agent model selection ships by forwarding the direct model/thinking RPC commands over Iroh, superseding the 2026-06-23 resolutions that kept them local-only (the "Fast Mode Policy Boundary" boundary on direct model RPC, the `/model` classification row, and the "Model/thinking" RPC-surface row). The earlier entries remain unedited as history.

Concrete behavior:

- The Iroh conversation-stream allowlist now forwards `get_available_models`, `set_model`, and `set_thinking_level`. `cycle_model` and `cycle_thinking_level` remain blocked; native clients have the full catalog and select explicitly.
- `get_available_models` exposes the auth-configured model catalog (full `Model` objects) to paired clients. This is an accepted widening of the earlier "no model catalogs over Iroh" boundary: remote `get_state` already shipped the full current `Model` object, custom-model API keys and custom request headers verifiably never reach `Model` objects, and pairing already grants prompt-level access to the workspace.
- Remote `set_model` matches CLI `/model` behavior exactly, including persisting the selection as the host default model/provider for future sessions (owner-chosen CLI parity; a phone-initiated change alters what new desktop sessions start with, and this is documented in the remote protocol doc). Both `set_model` and `set_thinking_level` accept an optional `persistDefault: false` for session-scoped changes that must not rewrite host defaults.
- `set_thinking_level` keeps host-side clamping. RPC `get_state` now reports `availableThinkingLevels` for the current model, `get_available_models` and the `set_model` response report them per model, and `set_thinking_level` returns the effective post-clamp `data.level`, so clients can render valid choices and detect clamping without provider capability matrices.
- Creation-time model selection needs no handshake change: the conversation hello is unchanged, and clients pipeline `set_model`/`set_thinking_level` (sent with `persistDefault: false`, since a per-agent override is not an owner-chosen new default) after the hello and before the first `prompt`; rpc-mode's sequential command queue guarantees ordering.
- `thinking.fast_mode` is unchanged and still session-local/non-persistent. Manual remote model/thinking changes clear the Fast mode restore marker through the same session paths as local changes.
- The E.5 preference-descriptor abstraction (global defaults, per-chat overrides, inheritance metadata) remains future work; this decision covers only direct selection for the bound session.

## Host Implementation Plan

### Phase A: Design and Inventory

1. Inventory existing built-in TUI slash commands.
2. Classify each as:
   - already has RPC equivalent,
   - easy remote-safe action,
   - requires native UI/dialog support,
   - local-only/TUI-only for now,
   - sensitive or not appropriate for remote.
3. Define the initial `UiActionDescriptor` TypeScript types.
4. Define `get_ui_capabilities`, `get_ui_actions`, and `invoke_ui_action` RPC types.
5. Decide the initial Iroh allowlist subset.

### Phase B: Read-Only/Compatibility Discovery

1. Add remote-safe command/action discovery for extension commands, prompt templates, and skills.
2. Omit or sanitize source paths.
3. Add iOS command palette support using descriptors.
4. Invoke extension/prompt/skill actions through existing `prompt` semantics internally.
5. Fix iOS prompt-response handling so prompt commands that complete without `agent_end` do not leave the app stuck in streaming state.

### Phase C: Shared Built-in Action Registry

1. Move simple built-ins from `interactive-mode.ts` into a shared action registry:
   - `session.new`
   - `context.compact`
   - `session.rename`
   - `run.cancel`
   - `session.resume` data-source hooks
2. Keep TUI slash names as aliases.
3. Expose the safe subset through RPC.
4. Add tests proving TUI slash and RPC action invocation hit the same handler.

### Phase D: Review and Model Actions

1. Refactor `/review` into shared action handlers:
   - `review.uncommitted`
   - `review.branch`
   - Local-only/deferred descriptors for `review.tools`, `review.pr`, and `review.commit`
2. Add native action descriptors for review cards.
3. Add `thinking.fast_mode` as the first model-speed action; defer full `model.fast_mode`.
4. Expose model/thinking state changes as action state updates.
5. Add iOS cards for Review and Fast mode.

### Phase E: Rich Extension Actions

1. Defer `volt.registerAction()` for v1 while preserving the projected-command compatibility path.
2. Define future stable extension-owned ids, descriptor validation, trust, and remote-safety fields before adding native extension handlers.
3. Keep descriptor argument schema and completion support for projected commands.
4. Render extension groups in iOS from remote-safe projected extension commands first; native extension cards wait for the future API.
5. Keep extension slash commands as compatibility palette actions.

## iOS Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Discovery and Palette

1. Add Swift models for action descriptors.
2. Add `VoltRPCCommand.getUIActions()` and `VoltRPCCommand.invokeUIAction(...)` once host support exists.
3. Load actions after connect/reconnect and session switch.
4. Add a searchable action palette.
5. Invoke simple no-arg actions and actions with a single string argument.
6. Keep existing prompt submission path as fallback.

### Phase 2: Native Cards

1. Add an Actions tab/page or sheet.
2. Render primary host actions as grouped cards.
3. Add built-in card layouts for Review, Model, Session, and Context groups.
4. Show disabled actions with host-provided reasons.
5. Add pending/completed/error UI around invocation responses.

### Phase 3: Forms and Toggles

1. Render descriptor-driven string/boolean/enum arguments.
2. Support `toggle` presentation and state refresh.
3. Add Fast mode card/toggle.
4. Add Review branch base form; add Review PR form only after PR policy is resolved.
5. Add model/thinking picker actions when remote-safe.

### Phase 4: Extension Cards

1. Render extension-provided remote-safe action cards.
2. Show source scope/package label.
3. Route extension dialogs through existing extension UI handling.
4. Add user affordances to hide or pin extension actions locally.

## Testing Plan

### Host Unit Tests

- `get_ui_actions` returns only remote-safe actions over Iroh.
- Action descriptors omit host-local paths and prompt/skill bodies.
- Disabled state updates when streaming starts/stops.
- Unknown action id returns a normal RPC error.
- Built-in action invocation re-checks availability at execution time.
- Extension command projection preserves invocation names, including duplicate suffixes.
- Prompt template and skill actions invoke through host expansion, not client expansion.
- `invoke_ui_action` for a prompt-like action returns success on acceptance and streams normal agent events.
- Actions that complete synchronously do not require `agent_end`.
- `thinking.fast_mode` lowers/restores thinking with default persistence disabled and does not mutate model, scoped-model, profile, or global default settings.
- Review descriptors expose only `review.uncommitted` and `review.branch` remotely, require confirmation, omit raw diffs/model/tool metadata, and keep `review.pr`, `review.commit`, and `review.tools` local-only or deferred.

### Host Integration Tests

- TUI `/compact` and RPC `invoke_ui_action(context.compact)` use the same core handler.
- TUI `/review uncommitted` and RPC `invoke_ui_action(review.uncommitted)` produce equivalent session behavior.
- Iroh remote rejects local-only actions.
- Iroh remote allows only the A.5 review subset, rejects `review.pr`, `review.commit`, and `review.tools`, and keeps direct git/gh/model/tool metadata out of descriptors and responses.
- Iroh remote exposes `thinking.fast_mode` only through the action allowlist and never exposes direct model listing/selection as part of the descriptor or response.
- Iroh outbound sanitizer applies to action responses and extension UI events.
- Revoked or unauthorized clients cannot invoke actions.
- Session switch/reload causes action descriptors to refresh.

### iOS Tests

- Command encoding for `get_ui_actions` and `invoke_ui_action`.
- Descriptor parsing skips invalid or partial action entries safely.
- Action list loads after connect/reconnect.
- Session switch clears/refreshes transcript and action list.
- Synchronous action response clears pending UI state without waiting for `agent_end`.
- Prompt-like action keeps streaming state until `agent_end`.
- Toggle state updates from response or refresh.
- Disabled actions render with reason and do not invoke.
- Fast mode toggle updates thinking state while leaving the displayed model unchanged.
- Review cards show confirmation, render the optional base-branch argument, and do not show local-only PR/commit/tool actions over Iroh.

### Manual iOS Smoke

1. Connect to a trusted host over Iroh.
2. Open the native Actions page.
3. Confirm primary cards load.
4. Tap Review uncommitted and verify a review run starts.
5. Tap Fast mode and verify thinking state updates while the model remains unchanged.
6. Invoke a skill from the command palette.
7. Invoke an extension command that emits a notification.
8. Disconnect/reconnect and verify actions refresh.
9. Try an action while streaming and verify disabled or queued behavior matches host state.

Record device, iOS version, macOS version, relay mode, workspace, and host commit.

## Migration Strategy

The design should not require a flag day.

1. Keep existing RPC commands working.
2. Keep raw `prompt` slash invocation working for extension commands, skills, and prompt templates.
3. Add action discovery as an optional capability.
4. Let iOS use actions opportunistically when available.
5. Gradually move TUI built-ins into shared action handlers.
6. Eventually make slash command autocomplete consume the same action registry.

## Open Decisions

1. **Action ids for extension commands**
   - Option A: deterministic hash of source info plus invocation name.
   - Option B: session-local ids that must be refreshed after reload.
   - Proposed: session-local opaque ids for v1 remote descriptors, with stable built-in ids only.
   - Resolved 2026-06-23: v1 uses session-local opaque ids for projected extension commands, prompt templates, and skills. Stable extension-owned action ids are deferred to the future `registerAction()` decision.

2. **Fast mode persistence**
   - Session-local, profile-level, or global setting.
   - Proposed first implementation: session-local or profile-level depending on existing settings model; avoid global surprises.
   - Resolved 2026-06-23: v1 `thinking.fast_mode` is session-local and non-persistent. It must not change profile/global defaults or scoped model settings.

3. **Remote model selection**
   - Current remote allowlist blocks `get_available_models` and `set_model`.
   - Need a separate remote-safe model policy review before exposing full model/provider metadata.
   - Fast mode may be safer than raw model selection because the host keeps provider policy private.
   - Resolved 2026-06-23: direct remote model listing/selection stays blocked. V1 exposes only `thinking.fast_mode`, which does not switch models or expose model catalog metadata. Full `model.fast_mode` is deferred pending separate model policy.

4. **Action result detail**
   - Keep invocation response small and rely on transcript/state events, or return richer action-specific results.
   - Proposed first implementation: small generic response plus normal events.
   - Resolved 2026-06-23: v1 uses the generic `UiActionInvocationResponse` with status, optional queue mode, and bounded state/action refresh hints. Rich action-specific result payloads are deferred.

5. **Built-in review exposure over Iroh**
   - Review can run git/gh commands and may inspect workspace data.
   - Need confirmation that this is acceptable for an authorized paired client and consistent with tool policy.
   - Resolved 2026-06-23: v1 remote review exposure is limited to `review.uncommitted` and `review.branch`, both requiring confirmation and read-only remote reviewer tools. `review.pr`, `review.commit`, and `review.tools` remain local-only or deferred pending GitHub credential/network, commit-history, and tool-provenance policy.

6. **Extension-provided card trust**
   - Project-local extension actions should only appear after project trust.
   - Need UI labeling so users can distinguish built-in and extension/package actions.
   - Resolved 2026-06-23: v1 does not add first-class extension-provided native card registration. Projected extension commands continue through the existing extension loading and trust path, and native iOS renders only sanitized source/scope/package labels. The future `registerAction()` design must define stable trust and descriptor fields before exposing extension-owned cards.

7. **Argument schema format**
   - Reuse TypeBox/JSON Schema subset or define a small custom schema.
   - Proposed first implementation: small custom schema for `string`, `boolean`, `enum`, and `integer`, with room for JSON Schema later.
   - Resolved 2026-06-23: v1 uses the small custom descriptor schema for string, multiline string, boolean, enum, and integer arguments. Hosts validate this subset before invocation, and unknown/unsupported types fail or disable generated forms.

8. **Action availability while streaming**
   - Some actions can execute immediately, some can queue, some must be disabled.
   - Need per-action `streamingBehavior`: `disabled`, `immediate`, `queueSteer`, `queueFollowUp`, or `custom`.
   - Resolved 2026-06-23: v1 supports `disabled`, `immediate`, `queueSteer`, and `queueFollowUp`. `custom` remains deferred; host handlers must recheck the live descriptor and reject unsupported streaming invocations.

9. **Chat-scoped defaults and model preference abstraction**
   - V1 `thinking.fast_mode` is a session-local non-persistent overlay.
   - Resolved 2026-06-23: future behavior uses a shared host-owned preference descriptor layer for Fast mode and model selection.
   - Native General settings can edit global defaults such as Fast mode on by default or a default model; chat settings/actions can edit a per-chat override.
   - Multiple conversations may have independent Fast mode and model overrides. Chats without an explicit override inherit the effective global/profile/scoped default.
   - Preference metadata exposes the effective value, whether it is inherited or chat-specific, allowed host-owned actions, reset-to-default behavior, and bounded disabled reasons.
   - Profiles and scoped models remain policy inputs and may constrain available values. Model selection remains blocked over Iroh until a separate remote-safe model option policy exists.

## Superseding Owner Decision 2026-07-21: Remote Commit and Pull Request Reviews

Issue [#80](https://github.com/volt-hq/Volt/issues/80) supersedes the 2026-06-23 deferral in Open Decision 5 for `review.commit` and `review.pr`. Both built-in actions may be invoked by authorized remote clients under the existing `conversation.control.v1` capability; this decision does not add a capability or change ordinary conversation tool grants.

- Both actions require confirmation and use the existing detached review workflow, retained result, and sanitized workflow-event paths.
- `review.commit` accepts one bounded revision expression, resolves it to a canonical commit object id before inspection, and passes only that id to `git show`, with textconv and external diff drivers disabled. Its descriptor discloses commit-history inspection and submission of commit metadata and diff to the review model.
- `review.pr` accepts an optional canonical positive decimal pull request number. An omitted number selects the current branch's pull request; explicit `null` is rejected. Its descriptor discloses use of the host's GitHub credentials and network and submission of pull request metadata and diff to the review model.
- Detached reviewers retain the host-owned read-only `read`, `grep`, `find`, and `ls` tool set regardless of ordinary conversation grants. `review.tools` remains local-only/deferred.
- Remote workflow metadata exposes bounded target identifiers only: a canonical commit object id or `PR #N`. Pull request title and body remain reviewer-only context, and pull request workflow tool events omit model-controlled string arguments.
- Configured-model fallback details and raw subprocess/provider diagnostics stay host-local; remote accepted responses, failures, workflow events, and retained results use bounded stable messages.
- Iroh allows these exact built-in ids through the existing remote-safe action check; near-prefix or unregistered ids remain denied.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A design exists for native iOS action cards and command palette backed by host-owned action descriptors.
- Slash commands are treated as aliases/presentation, not the canonical mobile protocol.
- The design supports built-in actions, extension commands, prompt templates, skills, and future extension-provided native actions.
- The design preserves the current remote security boundary and keeps source paths/template bodies/skill content out of descriptors.
- There is a phased plan that can start with remote-safe discovery and evolve into a shared TUI/RPC action registry.
- Review cards and Fast mode have concrete proposed action shapes.
- Tests cover descriptor safety, invocation semantics, iOS parsing, and synchronous-versus-streaming action behavior.

## Implementation Notes

- Resolved items should be recorded here as `Resolved YYYY-MM-DD:` entries.
- Initial implementation should prefer a narrow action subset over exposing broad local RPC capabilities.
- If an action would currently require exposing blocked RPC data over Iroh, it should stay local-only until its remote-safe projection is designed.
