<goal name="iroh-remote-productization-preview">

<context>
This file is the operating manual and work ledger for a Volt /goal run that moves
Iroh remote access from experimental proof-of-concept to supported preview quality.
The paired design document is `.volt/iroh-productization-design.md`; treat that file
as the SPEC (architecture, security model, open decisions, full acceptance criteria)
and this file as the TURN LEDGER (ordered queue, per-turn protocol, item status,
and evidence). Both files must be updated when a queue item is resolved.

Suggested goal prompt:
/goal Work through .volt/iroh-productization-goal.md, exactly one queue item per
goal turn, following the protocol in that file. Do not mark the goal complete until
every item in its work_queue has status="resolved". Commit after each resolved item
using the commit rules in the goal file.

If the user invokes this goal without explicit commit authorization, follow the repo
rule "Never commit unless the user asks": do all non-commit protocol steps, stop
before committing, and say which explicit paths are ready to stage.
</context>

<turn_definition>
A turn is one agent run from start until the final response is sent and the agent
becomes idle. Exactly ONE selectable work_queue item is worked per turn. If the
selected item finishes quickly, still stop after updating the ledgers and committing
(or stopping before commit when not authorized). Do not start another item in the
same turn.
</turn_definition>

<protocol>
  <step n="1" name="preflight">
    Run `git status --short`. Confirm the only unrelated dirty files are the
    out-of-scope files named in working_tree_rules, plus any in-progress files from
    a prior partial turn on the item you are about to re-select. If any other
    surprise dirty file exists, do not select an item: report the unexpected state
    and stop the turn.
  </step>

  <step n="2" name="select">
    Read the work_queue below. Select the FIRST item with status="open" whose
    prereq items, if any, all have status="resolved". Treat status="blocked" as
    not selectable. Items with type="rollup" are never selected directly; see
    rollup_rule. Work only the selected item this turn.
  </step>

  <step n="3" name="read_spec">
    Open `.volt/iroh-productization-design.md` and read the selected item's relevant
    SPEC sections in full. Also read the current implementation files that own the
    behavior before editing them; for Iroh this usually includes files under:

    - `packages/coding-agent/src/core/remote/iroh/`
    - `packages/coding-agent/src/core/rpc/iroh-transport.ts`
    - `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/rpc/iroh-remote-*.ts`
    - `packages/coding-agent/src/remote/iroh-host.mjs`
    - `packages/coding-agent/src/main.ts`
    - `packages/coding-agent/examples/remote/iroh-sidecar/`
    - `scripts/iroh-sidecar-*.mjs`

    Use LSP tools per &lt;lsp_usage/&gt; for semantic questions before changing shared
    TypeScript symbols. Use text search only to discover candidate files or where no
    language server covers the file, such as `.mjs` scripts.
  </step>

  <step n="4" name="implement">
    Normal items: implement the SPEC behavior faithfully and add or extend tests
    that would have failed before the fix and pass after it. Keep native Iroh
    dependency loading isolated from normal CLI startup. Preserve read-only remote
    defaults unless the selected item explicitly changes an authorization policy.

    type="decision" items: make the decision explicitly, record the decision and
    rationale in both ledgers, and implement only the code/docs needed by that
    decision in the same turn. A recorded defer/keep decision counts as resolving
    the item only if it includes enough rationale and acceptance notes for a future
    implementer.

    If the item requires native Iroh behavior, gather evidence per
    &lt;native_iroh_evidence/&gt; before committing to a design.
  </step>

  <step n="5" name="verify">
    After editing TypeScript files, run `lsp.diagnostics` on each changed TS/TSX
    file and fix reported diagnostics before launching slower verification. Then run
    the commands in &lt;verification/&gt;. All required checks must pass before the item
    may be marked resolved; verification commands, not LSP diagnostics, are
    authoritative.
  </step>

  <step n="6" name="update_ledgers">
    All dates in both ledgers use YYYY-MM-DD format.

    `.volt/iroh-productization-design.md`: update the relevant SPEC section,
    graduation checklist, and/or open decision with `Resolved YYYY-MM-DD:` plus the
    concrete fix or decision. Do not silently delete unresolved requirements; if the
    selected item reveals new scope, add a new open item instead.

    This file: set the selected item status="resolved" and fill its &lt;evidence&gt;
    with one concise line containing what changed, what verification ran, and the
    commit SHA when a commit was made. For partial progress, follow
    partial_progress_rule instead.
  </step>

  <step n="7" name="commit">
    If commit authorization is present, stage only files changed for the selected
    item, by explicit path. Never use `git add -A` or `git add .`.

    Commit message format:
    code fix:          fix(coding-agent): resolve Iroh productization §REF — &lt;short summary&gt;
    docs-only/decision: docs(coding-agent): record Iroh productization §REF — &lt;short summary&gt;
    partial progress:  fix(coding-agent): Iroh productization §REF partial — &lt;short summary&gt;

    If commit authorization is absent, do not commit. Leave the item status open
    unless the user explicitly accepts non-committed ledger updates; report the
    paths ready to stage and stop.
  </step>

  <step n="8" name="stop">
    Summarize what changed and what verification ran, then end the turn.

<lsp_usage>
Volt has LSP tools available through the `lsp` tool with actions such as
`definition`, `references`, `hover`, `symbols`, `diagnostics`, `rename`, and `fix`.
Prefer LSP over grep/read whenever the question is semantic: who calls this, where
is this symbol defined, what type is this, or what breaks if this signature changes.

Per-turn usage:

- While reading the selected item, use `lsp.symbols` to locate the relevant TS
  symbol when the file is not obvious.
- Before changing a shared TS symbol's behavior or signature, call
  `lsp.references`; every caller is potentially a test or behavior surface that
  must be considered in the same turn.
- For renames, use `lsp.rename`, not find-and-replace.
- After editing, run `lsp.diagnostics` on each changed TS/TSX file.
- `.mjs`, `.cjs`, Markdown, and shell scripts may not have semantic LSP coverage;
  text-inspect those files and mention that in evidence when relevant.
- A timeout or no-server result is not a blocker; fall back to reading/searching
  the file and record the fallback if it matters.
</lsp_usage>

<native_iroh_evidence>
Use native Iroh evidence when the selected item depends on endpoint-ticket behavior,
relay behavior, native stream lifecycle, or active connection handling.

Evidence sources:

- Automated local scenario suite: `npm run iroh:poc:test`.
- Focused source tests under `packages/coding-agent/test/*iroh*`.
- Manual same-machine host/client smoke test with `npm run iroh:poc:host:volt` and
  `npm run iroh:poc:client`.
- Manual relay test with `--relay default` on two networks when relay behavior is
  part of the item.
- Minimal direct inspection of `@number0/iroh` types/API in `node_modules` when an
  item depends on native API shape. Do not guess external API behavior.

Rules:

- Do not add `@number0/iroh` imports to TypeScript core modules.
- Do not move native loading out of `src/remote/iroh-native-adapter.cjs` and
  `src/remote/iroh-host.mjs` unless the selected item explicitly changes the
  packaging architecture.
- If optional native dependency is unavailable in the local environment, document
  the blocker on the selected item. Do not mark native-dependent behavior resolved
  from unit tests alone.
- Do not include secrets, provider API keys, raw tickets, or local private paths in
  committed evidence. Redact or summarize.
</native_iroh_evidence>

<working_tree_rules>
Expected out-of-scope dirty files during productization turns: none.

This setup turn may leave `.volt/iroh-productization-design.md` and
`.volt/iroh-productization-goal.md` uncommitted until the user decides whether to
commit the planning documents. Future implementation turns should treat these two
files as in-scope only when updating ledgers for the selected item.

Multiple Volt sessions may share the same worktree. Never stage or commit files you
did not modify for the selected item. If `git status --short` shows unrelated dirty
files, stop before selecting work.
</working_tree_rules>

<partial_progress_rule>
If the selected item is too large to finish in one turn but coherent progress is
possible, this is not a block. Work only that item, keep it status="open", add a
`&lt;progress date="YYYY-MM-DD"&gt;` child describing what changed and what remains,
run the verification required for the files changed, and commit only coherent
completed progress if commit authorization is present. The next turn will re-select
this same item because it remains the first selectable open item.
</partial_progress_rule>

<rollup_rule>
Items with type="rollup" are never selected directly. When a turn resolves the
final prerequisite of a rollup item, mark the rollup resolved in this file and
update the design doc checklist during that same turn. Do not spend a separate turn
on a rollup item.
</rollup_rule>

<blocked_rule>
If the selected item cannot proceed at all, or its remaining portion cannot proceed
because required evidence, credentials, a supported platform, or a human product
decision is unavailable:

1. Do whatever portion is achievable without the blocker, following
   partial_progress_rule.
2. Add a `Blocked YYYY-MM-DD:` note to `.volt/iroh-productization-design.md` under
   the relevant section and set this file's item status="blocked" with a
   `&lt;blocker&gt;` child explaining what is needed.
3. Stop the turn. Later turns do not select blocked items unless the blocker is
   plausibly cleared.
4. Mark the overall goal blocked only when no selectable open item remains.
</blocked_rule>

<completion_rule>
Do not declare the goal complete until every work_queue item has status="resolved",
the rollup item is resolved, and the final turn's required verification passed.
</completion_rule>

    <evidence>Resolved 2026-06-21: added `lastSessionIdByWorkspace` state parsing/cloning/persistence, integrated remote runtime session selection and audit events for session_created/session_resumed/session_missing_on_resume, state updates after runtime creation, and duplicate same-client/workspace handshake rejection from E.1; verification: lsp.diagnostics on changed TS/test files, node --check packages/coding-agent/src/remote/iroh-host.mjs, cd packages/coding-agent &amp;&amp; node node_modules/vitest/dist/cli.js --run test/remote-iroh-core.test.ts test/iroh-remote-agent-runtime.test.ts, npm run iroh:poc:test, npm run check, git diff --check; commit db2201e7</evidence>

    <title>Add reconnect scenario coverage for same-client resume, missing-session fallback, and duplicate active connection behavior from E.1</title>
    <acceptance>`npm run iroh:poc:test` covers reconnecting with the same client state, verifies same session ID after reconnect, verifies new session after deleting the saved session, and verifies duplicate connection behavior; failures produce actionable diagnostics without PHI or raw secrets.</acceptance>
    <evidence>Resolved 2026-06-21: extended `npm run iroh:poc:test` with integrated reconnect scenarios for same-client session resume, missing-session fallback, audit checks, and duplicate same-client/workspace stream rejection while preserving the first stream and proving reconnect succeeds after close; verification: node --check packages/coding-agent/src/remote/iroh-host.mjs scripts/iroh-sidecar-test.mjs, npm run iroh:poc:test, npm run check, git diff --check; commit e274d961</evidence>
