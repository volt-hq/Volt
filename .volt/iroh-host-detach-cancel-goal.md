<goal name="iroh-host-detach-cancel-semantics">

<context>
This file is the operating manual and work ledger for a Volt /goal run that
decouples remote Iroh client transport lifetime from host prompt/run lifetime.
The paired design document is `.volt/iroh-host-detach-cancel-design.md`; treat
that file as the SPEC and this file as the TURN LEDGER. Update both files when a
queue item is resolved or when implementation reveals a necessary design change.

Suggested goal prompt:
/goal Work through .volt/iroh-host-detach-cancel-goal.md, exactly one queue item
per goal turn, following the protocol in that file. Do not mark the goal complete
until every item in its work_queue has status="resolved". Commit only files
changed for the selected item, by explicit path, when committing is safe under
the repo rules; if commit ownership or target repo is unclear, stop before
committing and list the exact paths ready to stage.
</context>

<turn_definition>
A turn is one agent run from start until the final response is sent and the agent
becomes idle. Exactly ONE selectable work_queue item is worked per turn. If the
selected item finishes quickly, still stop after updating ledgers and committing
(or stopping before commit when commit safety is unclear). Do not start another
item in the same turn.
</turn_definition>

<protocol>
  <step n="1" name="preflight">
    Run `git status --short` in `/Users/jordan.hans/Projects/Volt` and
    `git -C ../volt-app status --short`. Confirm dirty files are either:
    baseline out-of-scope files listed in working_tree_rules, the paired docs for
    this goal, or in-progress files from a prior partial turn on the item you are
    about to re-select. If any other surprise dirty file exists, do not select an
    item: report the unexpected state and stop the turn.
  </step>

  <step n="2" name="select">
    Read the work_queue below. Select the FIRST item with status="open" whose
    prereq items, if any, all have status="resolved". Treat status="blocked" as
    not selectable. Items with type="rollup" are never selected directly; see
    rollup_rule. Work only the selected item this turn.
  </step>

  <step n="3" name="read_spec">
    Read `.volt/iroh-host-detach-cancel-design.md` and the selected item's
    relevant sections in full. Also read the current implementation files that
    own the behavior before editing them. Expected areas include:

    - `packages/coding-agent/src/remote/iroh-host.mjs`
    - `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/rpc/rpc-mode.ts`
    - `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/rpc/iroh-remote-rpc-mode.ts`

    - `packages/coding-agent/test/remote-iroh-core.test.ts`
    - `scripts/iroh-sidecar-test.mjs`

    Use LSP tools per &lt;lsp_usage/&gt; for semantic TypeScript questions before
    changing shared symbols. Use text search for `.mjs`, `.cjs`, Markdown, shell
    scripts, and other files without language server coverage.
  </step>

  <step n="4" name="implement">
    Implement the SPEC behavior faithfully for the selected item and add or
    extend tests that would have failed before the change and pass after it.
    Preserve the remote security boundary: do not expose raw `get_messages` over
    Iroh, do not return session file paths, keep transcript loading scoped to the
    active authorized workspace/session, and bound large transcript fields.
  </step>

  <step n="5" name="verify">
    After editing TypeScript files, run `lsp.diagnostics` on each changed TS/TSX
    file and fix reported diagnostics before launching slower verification. Then
    run the commands in &lt;verification/&gt;. All required checks for changed files
    must pass before the item may be marked resolved. If native Iroh behavior,
    iOS hardware, credentials, or a manual environment is unavailable, follow
    blocked_rule or partial_progress_rule instead of overclaiming.
  </step>

  <step n="6" name="update_ledgers">
    All dates in both ledgers use YYYY-MM-DD format.

    `.volt/iroh-host-detach-cancel-design.md`: update the relevant section with
    `Resolved YYYY-MM-DD:` plus the concrete behavior when an item is resolved.
    Do not silently delete unresolved requirements; if the selected item reveals
    new scope, add a new open item instead.

    This file: set the selected item status="resolved" and fill its
    &lt;evidence&gt; with one concise line containing what changed, what verification
    ran, and the commit SHA when a commit was made. For partial progress, follow
    partial_progress_rule instead.
  </step>

  <step n="7" name="commit">
    If committing is safe under the repo rules, stage only files changed for the
    selected item, by explicit path. Never use `git add -A` or `git add .`.

    Suggested commit message formats:
    code fix: `fix(coding-agent): preserve remote runs across detach &lt;ref&gt;`
    docs-only: `docs(coding-agent): record remote detach semantics &lt;ref&gt;`
    partial progress: `fix(coding-agent): remote detach semantics &lt;ref&gt; partial`

    If not committing, leave the item status open unless the user explicitly
    accepts non-committed ledger updates; report the exact paths ready to stage
    and stop.
  </step>

  <step n="8" name="stop">
    Summarize what changed and what verification ran, then end the turn.

  <notes>
    `npm run check` is required after Volt code changes and must be run from the
    Volt repo root. If a test file is created or modified, run the specific test
    file and iterate until it passes before broader checks. Use native Iroh
    scenario evidence for connection lifecycle behavior. Manual iOS validation is
    required only for the final validation item unless a selected item explicitly
    changes iOS-facing protocol behavior.

<lsp_usage>
Volt has LSP tools available through the `lsp` tool with actions such as
`definition`, `references`, `hover`, `symbols`, `diagnostics`, `rename`, and
`fix`. Prefer LSP over grep/read whenever the question is semantic: who calls
this, where is this symbol defined, what type is this, or what breaks if this
signature changes.

Per-turn usage:

- Use `lsp.symbols` to locate relevant TypeScript symbols when the file is not
  obvious.
- Before changing a shared TS symbol's behavior or signature, call
  `lsp.references`; every caller is potentially a behavior or test surface that
  must be considered in the same turn.
- For renames, use `lsp.rename`, not find-and-replace.
- After editing, run `lsp.diagnostics` on each changed TS/TSX file.
- `.mjs`, `.cjs`, Markdown, shell scripts, and Swift files may not have semantic
  LSP coverage; read/search those files directly and mention that fallback in
  evidence when relevant.
</lsp_usage>

<working_tree_rules>
This setup turn may leave `.volt/iroh-host-detach-cancel-design.md` and
`.volt/iroh-host-detach-cancel-goal.md` uncommitted until the user decides
whether to commit planning documents.

At setup time on 2026-06-22, this worktree already contained unrelated
transcript-resume changes. Treat these baseline paths as out-of-scope unless the
selected detach/cancel item intentionally edits the same path:

- `.volt/ios-remote-transcript-resume-design.md`
- `.volt/ios-remote-transcript-resume-goal.md`
- `package-lock.json`

Multiple Volt sessions may share the same worktree. Never stage or commit files
you did not modify for the selected item. If you need to edit a baseline-dirty
path, inspect its existing diff first and make only the selected item's changes.
</working_tree_rules>

<partial_progress_rule>
If the selected item is too large to finish in one turn but coherent progress is
possible, this is not a block. Work only that item, keep it status="open", add a
`&lt;progress date="YYYY-MM-DD"&gt;` child describing what changed and what remains,
run verification required for the files changed, and commit only coherent
completed progress if committing is safe. The next turn will re-select this same
item because it remains the first selectable open item.
</partial_progress_rule>

<rollup_rule>
Items with type="rollup" are never selected directly. When a turn resolves the
final prerequisite of a rollup item, mark the rollup resolved in this file and
update the design doc checklist during that same turn. Do not spend a separate
turn on a rollup item.
</rollup_rule>

<blocked_rule>
If the selected item cannot proceed at all, or its remaining portion cannot
proceed because required evidence, credentials, a supported platform, a simulator,
native Iroh support, iOS hardware access, or a human product decision is
unavailable:

1. Do whatever portion is achievable without the blocker, following
   partial_progress_rule.
2. Add a `Blocked YYYY-MM-DD:` note to
   `.volt/iroh-host-detach-cancel-design.md` under the relevant section and set
   this file's item status="blocked" with a `&lt;blocker&gt;` child explaining what
   is needed.
3. Stop the turn. Later turns do not select blocked items unless the blocker is
   plausibly cleared.
4. Mark the overall goal blocked only when no selectable open item remains.
</blocked_rule>

<completion_rule>
Do not declare the goal complete until every work_queue item has status="resolved",
the rollup item is resolved, and the final turn's required verification passed.
</completion_rule>
