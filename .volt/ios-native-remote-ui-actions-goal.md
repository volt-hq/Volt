<goal name="ios-native-remote-ui-actions">

<context>
This file is the operating manual and work ledger for a Volt /goal run that
adds a native remote UI action layer for the iOS app. The paired design document
is `.volt/ios-native-remote-ui-actions-design.md`; treat that file as the SPEC
and this file as the TURN LEDGER. Update both files when a queue item is
resolved or when implementation reveals a necessary design change.

The long-term product direction is: iOS should render native cards, buttons,
toggles, pickers, and command palettes for host-owned actions instead of
mirroring the terminal TUI or sending raw slash-command strings as the canonical
protocol. Slash commands remain aliases/presentation. The host owns action
availability, execution, security policy, model policy, prompt/template/skill
expansion, and extension command execution.

Suggested goal prompt:
/goal Work through .volt/ios-native-remote-ui-actions-goal.md, exactly one queue
item per goal turn, following the protocol in that file. Do not mark the goal
complete until every item in its work_queue has status="resolved". Commit only
files changed for the selected item, by explicit path, when committing is safe
under the repo rules; if commit ownership, target repo, branch, remote, or
security implications are unclear, stop before committing and list the exact
paths ready to stage.
</context>

<turn_definition>
A turn is one agent run from start until the final response is sent and the agent
becomes idle. Exactly ONE selectable work_queue item is worked per turn. If the
selected item finishes quickly, still stop after updating ledgers and committing
(or stopping before commit when commit safety is unclear). Do not start another
item in the same turn.
</turn_definition>

<protocol>
  <step n="1" name="preflight">
    Run `git status --short` in `/Users/jordan.hans/Projects/Volt` and
    `git -C ../volt-app status --short`. Confirm dirty files are either the
    paired planning docs named in working_tree_rules or in-progress files from a
    prior partial turn on the item you are about to re-select. If any other
    surprise dirty file exists, do not select an item: report the unexpected
    state and stop the turn.
  </step>

  <step n="2" name="select">
    Read the work_queue below. Select the FIRST item with status="open" whose
    prereq items, if any, all have status="resolved". Treat status="blocked" as
    not selectable. Items with type="rollup" are never selected directly; see
    rollup_rule. Work only the selected item this turn.
  </step>

  <step n="3" name="read_spec">
    Read `.volt/ios-native-remote-ui-actions-design.md` and the selected item's
    relevant sections in full. Also read current implementation files that own
    the behavior before editing them. Expected Volt host/protocol areas include:

    Use LSP tools per &lt;lsp_usage/&gt; for semantic TypeScript questions before
    changing shared symbols. For Swift files, read the owning files and run the
    Swift verification commands because Swift LSP may not be available.
  </step>

  <step n="4" name="implement_or_decide">
    Implement the SPEC behavior faithfully for the selected item and add or
    extend tests that would have failed before the change and pass after it.

    type="decision" items: make the decision explicitly, record it in the design
    document and this ledger, and implement only the docs/tests/code needed by
    that decision in the same turn. A defer/keep-narrow decision counts as
    resolving the item only if it includes enough rationale and acceptance notes
    for a future implementer.

    Preserve the remote security boundary:

    - Do not expose raw `get_messages` over Iroh.
    - Do not expose host session file paths or extension source file paths in
      remote action descriptors.
    - Do not expose prompt template bodies or full skill content in descriptors.
    - Do not expose provider secrets, environment values, auth internals, or raw
      local model/provider metadata without a separate remote policy decision.
    - Re-check action availability and authorization at invocation time even if
      the client presents a stale descriptor.
    - Keep all Iroh remote additions allowlist-based.
  </step>

  <step n="5" name="verify">
    After editing TypeScript files, run `lsp.diagnostics` on each changed TS/TSX
    file and fix reported diagnostics before launching slower verification. Then
    run the commands in &lt;verification/&gt; that apply to changed files. All required
    checks for changed files must pass before the item may be marked resolved. If
    native Iroh behavior, iOS simulator/device access, credentials, model access,
    or a product decision is unavailable, follow blocked_rule or
    partial_progress_rule instead of overclaiming.
  </step>

  <step n="6" name="update_ledgers">
    All dates in both ledgers use YYYY-MM-DD format.

    `.volt/ios-native-remote-ui-actions-design.md`: update the relevant section
    with `Resolved YYYY-MM-DD:` plus the concrete behavior or decision when an
    item is resolved. Do not silently delete unresolved requirements; if the
    selected item reveals new scope, add a new open item instead.

    This file: set the selected item status="resolved" and fill its
    &lt;evidence&gt; with one concise line containing what changed, what verification
    ran, and the commit SHA when a commit was made. For partial progress, follow
    partial_progress_rule instead.
  </step>

  <step n="7" name="commit">
    If committing is safe under the repo rules, stage only files changed for the
    selected item, by explicit path. Never use `git add -A` or `git add .`.

    If the selected item changes both `/Users/jordan.hans/Projects/Volt` and
    `../volt-app`, commit them separately in their respective repositories unless
    the user requested otherwise. Ask before committing or pushing if scope,
    target branch, remote, ownership, or lockfile implications are unclear.

    Suggested commit message formats:
    Volt protocol/code: `feat(coding-agent): add native remote UI actions &lt;ref&gt;`
    Volt docs/decision: `docs(coding-agent): record native remote UI action decision &lt;ref&gt;`
    Volt tests only: `fix(coding-agent): cover native remote UI actions &lt;ref&gt;`
    iOS app: `feat: add native Volt action cards &lt;ref&gt;`
    iOS tests/docs: `test: cover native Volt actions &lt;ref&gt;`

    If not committing, leave the item status open unless the user explicitly
    accepts non-committed ledger updates; report the exact paths ready to stage
    and stop.

    `npm run check` is required after Volt code changes and must be run from the
    Volt repo root. If a test file is created or modified, run the specific test
    file and iterate until it passes before broader checks. For iOS simulator
    verification, if the named simulator is unavailable, choose an available iOS
    simulator and record the exact destination used. Manual UI smoke is required
    only for final validation or for items that change visible iOS behavior.

<lsp_usage>
Volt has LSP tools available through the `lsp` tool with actions such as
`definition`, `references`, `hover`, `symbols`, `diagnostics`, `rename`, and
`fix`. Prefer LSP over grep/read whenever the question is semantic: who calls
this, where is this symbol defined, what type is this, or what breaks if this
signature changes.

Per-turn usage:

- Use `lsp.symbols` to locate relevant TypeScript symbols when the file is not
  obvious.
- Before changing a shared TS symbol's behavior or signature, call
  `lsp.references`; every caller is potentially a behavior or test surface that
  must be considered in the same turn.
- For renames, use `lsp.rename`, not find-and-replace.
- After editing, run `lsp.diagnostics` on each changed TS/TSX file.
- `.mjs`, `.cjs`, Markdown, shell scripts, and Swift files may not have semantic
  LSP coverage; read/search those files directly and mention that fallback in
  evidence when relevant.
</lsp_usage>

<working_tree_rules>
This setup turn may leave these planning files uncommitted until the user decides
whether to commit them:

- `.volt/ios-native-remote-ui-actions-design.md`
- `.volt/ios-native-remote-ui-actions-goal.md`

Expected out-of-scope dirty files during native-remote-ui-action turns: none
beyond the planning files above. Multiple Volt sessions may share the same
worktree. Never stage or commit files you did not modify for the selected item.
If either repository shows unrelated dirty files beyond the allowances above,
stop before selecting work.
</working_tree_rules>

<partial_progress_rule>
If the selected item is too large to finish in one turn but coherent progress is
possible, this is not a block. Work only that item, keep it status="open", add a
`&lt;progress date="YYYY-MM-DD"&gt;` child describing what changed and what remains,
run verification required for the files changed, and commit only coherent
completed progress if committing is safe. The next turn will re-select this same
item because it remains the first selectable open item.
</partial_progress_rule>

<rollup_rule>
Items with type="rollup" are never selected directly. When a turn resolves the
final prerequisite of a rollup item, mark the rollup resolved in this file and
update the design doc checklist during that same turn. Do not spend a separate
turn on a rollup item.
</rollup_rule>

<blocked_rule>
If the selected item cannot proceed at all, or its remaining portion cannot
proceed because required evidence, credentials, a supported platform, a simulator,
a real iOS device, native Iroh support, provider/model access, or a human product
decision is unavailable:

1. Do whatever portion is achievable without the blocker, following
   partial_progress_rule.
2. Add a `Blocked YYYY-MM-DD:` note to
   `.volt/ios-native-remote-ui-actions-design.md` under the relevant section and
   set this file's item status="blocked" with a `&lt;blocker&gt;` child explaining what
   is needed.
3. Stop the turn. Later turns do not select blocked items unless the blocker is
   plausibly cleared.
4. Mark the overall goal blocked only when no selectable open item remains.
</blocked_rule>

<completion_rule>
Do not declare the goal complete until every work_queue item has status="resolved",
the rollup item is resolved, and the final turn's required verification passed.
Final evidence must include host automated tests, Iroh remote allowlist/security
tests for exposed actions, Swift package tests, iOS UI/state tests, and at least
one iOS simulator or real-device native action smoke, unless explicitly blocked
and recorded without overclaiming.
</completion_rule>

    <acceptance>Remote-safe extension-provided actions or projected extension commands can appear in iOS extension/action groups with safe source labels; users can distinguish built-in versus extension/package actions; extension UI requests continue to render or degrade through the existing RPC UI protocol; tests cover extension action visibility, source labeling, disabled state, and invocation.</acceptance>

    <title>Update protocol, extension, skill, prompt-template, and iOS docs for native actions</title>
    <acceptance>`packages/coding-agent/docs/rpc.md`, `docs/iroh-remote-protocol.md`, `docs/extensions.md`, `docs/prompt-templates.md`, `docs/skills.md`, the paired design doc, and relevant iOS README/user-facing docs describe native UI actions, slash aliases, discovery, invocation, security limits, extension command projection, skills/templates, and unsupported/deferred surfaces. Changelog entries are added where appropriate.</acceptance>

  <item ref="F.2" status="open" prereq="E.2,F.1">
    <title>Run final cross-surface validation for native remote UI actions</title>
    <acceptance>Final evidence lists exact targeted Vitest files, Iroh scenario tests when remote RPC changed, `npm run check`, Swift package tests, iOS simulator tests, doc checks, and manual native iOS smoke. Manual smoke covers connect, load action list, invoke a prompt-like action, invoke a synchronous action or toggle, refresh after reconnect/session switch, and verify no raw sensitive metadata is exposed. Unsupported cases are documented without overclaiming.</acceptance>

    <title>Rollup: native remote UI actions are implemented, tested, documented, and ready for iOS preview use</title>
    <acceptance>All prior items are resolved; design decisions and limitations are recorded; no open implementation decisions remain except explicitly deferred future work; final automated and manual validation evidence is recorded; migration notes explain how existing raw slash prompt compatibility remains supported.</acceptance>
