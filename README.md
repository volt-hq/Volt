# Volt Agent Harness Monorepo

Volt is a local coding-agent monorepo with a CLI, agent runtime, provider API, and terminal UI package.

Volt is maintained and distributed by [Jordan Hans](https://github.com/hansjm10).
It is derived from [Mario Zechner's Pi project](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono)
and remains available under the MIT License.

> New issues and PRs from new contributors are auto-closed by default. Maintainers review auto-closed issues daily. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Remote Access Preview

`volt remote host` can expose a local Volt runtime to a paired phone over Iroh
without moving provider credentials or repository files off the host. Pairing is
workstation-scoped: register local workspaces by name, pair the phone once with
`volt remote pair`, then the phone can open known workspace names without another
QR scan.

Integrated hosts advertise `multi_streams.v1` and `conversation_streams.v1`.
Mobile streams bind during the Iroh handshake to one workspace/session
conversation: `target:last`, `target:new`, or `target:session`. The iOS app
renders those conversations as pinned agent tabs, including multiple sessions
inside the same registered workspace. Commands, transcripts, native actions,
host actions, notifications, Live Activity registration, and `/workspace` path
mapping stay scoped to the bound conversation stream.

Workspace discovery and management use short-lived utility streams. Discovery
permits only `list_sessions`; management permits only authorized
`unregister_workspace`. Mobile conversation streams no longer use direct
`new_session`, `switch_session_by_id`, or raw `get_messages`; new and resumed
agents are selected by opening a targeted conversation stream, and transcript
recovery uses bounded `get_transcript` plus sanitized `transcript_entry` events.

Closing a stream, switching tabs, app backgrounding, or network loss is detach
only. User cancellation is the selected stream's `abort` RPC command. Same
client/workspace/session duplicates fail with `duplicate_conversation_connection`
and retry metadata; another client owning the same conversation fails with
`conversation_in_use`. Revocation, workspace authorization removal, and
workspace unregister close only affected streams and retained runtimes. Host
process exit is not durable active-work recovery, and large hidden-agent sets may
need future resource controls.

See [Using Volt](packages/coding-agent/docs/usage.md#remote-access-over-iroh-preview),
[Security](packages/coding-agent/docs/security.md#remote-access-over-iroh-preview),
and [Iroh Remote Protocol v1](packages/coding-agent/docs/iroh-remote-protocol.md)
for setup commands, fallback behavior for old hosts, and the wire contract.

## Permissions And Containerization

Volt does not include a built-in permission system for restricting filesystem, process, network, or credential access. By default, it runs with the permissions of the user and process that launched it.

If you need stronger boundaries, containerize or sandbox Volt. See [packages/coding-agent/docs/containerization.md](packages/coding-agent/docs/containerization.md) for three patterns:

- **Gondolin extension**: keep `volt` and provider auth on the host while routing built-in tools and `!` commands into a local Linux micro-VM.
- **Plain Docker**: run the whole `volt` process in a local container for simple isolation.
- **OpenShell**: run the whole `volt` process in a policy-controlled sandbox.

## Development

```bash
npm install --ignore-scripts  # Install all dependencies without running lifecycle scripts
npm run check                 # Lint, format, and type check
./test.sh                     # Run tests without e2e provider tests
./volt-test.sh                # Run volt from sources
```

## Supply Chain

We treat npm dependency changes as reviewed code changes.

- Direct external dependencies are pinned to exact versions. Internal workspace packages remain version-ranged.
- `.npmrc` sets `save-exact=true` and `min-release-age=2` to avoid same-day dependency releases during npm resolution.
- `package-lock.json` is the dependency ground truth. Pre-commit blocks accidental lockfile commits unless `VOLT_ALLOW_LOCKFILE_CHANGE=1` is set.
- `npm run check` verifies pinned direct deps, native TypeScript import compatibility, and the generated coding-agent shrinkwrap.
- The published CLI package includes `packages/coding-agent/npm-shrinkwrap.json`, generated from the root lockfile, to pin transitive deps for npm users.
- Local release installs, documented npm installs, and `volt update --self` use `--ignore-scripts` where supported.
