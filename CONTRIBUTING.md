# Contributing to Volt

This guide exists to save both sides time.

## Philosophy

First things first: **Volt's core is minimal**.

If your feature does not belong in the core, it should be an extension. PRs that bloat the core will likely be rejected.

Volt's core exists to be minimal and to be extensible so that it can be influenced and manipulated by extensions. Even hook points for extensions however should be well considered and discussed to avoid adding unmaintainable bloat and complex interactions.

## The One Rule

**You must understand your code.** If you cannot explain what your changes do and how they interact with the rest of the system, your PR will be closed.

Using AI to write code is fine. Submitting AI-generated slop without understanding it is not.

If you use an agent, run it from the `volt` root directory so it picks up `AGENTS.md` automatically. Your agent must follow the rules and guidelines in that file.

## Contribution Gate

All issues and PRs from new contributors are auto-closed by default.

Issues submitted Friday through Sunday are not guaranteed to be reviewed.
Security-sensitive reports must follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead of
using the public issue tracker.

Maintainers review auto-closed issues daily and reopen worthwhile ones. Issues that do not meet the quality bar below will not be reopened or receive a reply.

Approval happens through maintainer replies on issues:

- `lgtmi`: your future issues will not be auto-closed
- `lgtm`: your future issues and PRs will not be auto-closed

`lgtmi` does not grant rights to submit PRs. Only `lgtm` grants rights to submit PRs.

## Quality Bar For Issues

If you open an issue, you must use one of the two GitHub issue templates.

If you open an issue, keep it short, concrete, and worth reading.

- Keep it concise. If it does not fit on one screen, it is too long.
- Write in your own voice (do not use an LLM to generate text, if you must, follow up with a clearly AI labeled comment).
- State the bug or request clearly.
- Explain why it matters.
- If you want to implement the change yourself, say so.

If the issue is real and written well, a maintainer may reopen it, reply `lgtmi`, or reply `lgtm`.

## Blocking

If you ignore this document twice, or if you spam the tracker with agent-generated issues, your GitHub account will be permanently blocked.

If you send a large volume of issues through automation, your GitHub account will be permanently blocked. No taksies backsies.

## Before Submitting a PR

Do not open a PR unless you have already been approved with `lgtm`.

Before submitting a PR:

```bash
npm run check
./test.sh
```

Both must pass.

Do not edit `CHANGELOG.md`. Changelog entries are added by maintainers.

If you are adding a new provider to `packages/ai`, see `AGENTS.md` for required tests.

## Questions?

Use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/hansjm10/Volt/issues) for
concise, non-sensitive questions that meet the contribution gate above.

## FAQ

### Why are new issues and PRs auto-closed?

Volt receives more issues than the maintainers can responsibly review in real time. Many reports do not meet the quality bar in this guide or do not follow CONTRIBUTING.md. Some are slung at the repository mindlessly via an agent instead of being reviewed and shaped by the person submitting them. Auto-closing creates a buffer so maintainers can review the tracker on their own schedule and reopen the issues that meet the quality bar.

### Why are weekend issues lower priority?

We triage the tracker during working hours. That means more issues can accumulate over the weekend. Anything submitted Friday through Sunday may be missed or given lower priority in the Monday review queue.

### Why do some issues get no reply?

A reply is maintenance work too. Low-signal issues, unclear reports, duplicates, and issues that do not follow this guide may be closed without discussion. This keeps time available for reproducible bugs, thoughtful requests, and contributors who have done the work to make their report actionable.

### Why not let AI triage everything?

AI can help group duplicates, summarize reports, and spot missing information. It is not trusted to make final maintainer decisions. Polished AI-generated issues can still be wrong, misleading, or expensive to investigate. Human review remains the final gate.

### Is this hostile to contributors?

No. It is a guardrail against burnout and tracker spam. Short, concrete, reproducible issues are welcome. Thoughtful contributions are welcome. Automated slop, entitlement, and large volumes of low-effort reports are not.

## Where can I learn about plans?

Propose larger Volt changes in the
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/hansjm10/Volt/issues) before starting
implementation. Historical Pi design material remains upstream and does not
represent the Volt roadmap.
